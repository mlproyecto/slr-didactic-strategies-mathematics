In this study we investigate digitally skilled K-12 mathematics teachers' (N=85) attitudes towards and expectations on the role of artificial intelligence in the classroom. The study was done by conducting and analyzing the results of a web-based survey among Swedish and Finnish speaking mathematics teachers using a mixed methods strategy. The Will, Skill and Tool framework was used for the analysis. The survey was done before the introduction of ChatGPT-3. The results indicate that the teachers' attitudes toward AI tools in school are characterized by interest, openness, and awareness. Teachers have a balanced view on the possibilities and risks of AI use in school. However, the teachers also stress that there is a risk that AI tools will shift the focus from learning key mathematical skills towards learning and interaction with the AI tools themselves.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","1117-1136","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1425748","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1425748","Artificial Intelligence; Accuracy; Algebra; Algorithms; Electronic Learning; Error of Measurement; High School Seniors; Mathematics Achievement; Prediction; Student Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group.

"GGKJ4XHH","thesis","2023","Zhang, Ziyi","Introducing Reinforcement Learning to High School Students through the Integration of Physical Robots and Virtual Interfaces","","","","","","As artificial intelligence (AI) plays a more prominent role in our everyday lives, it becomes increasingly important to introduce basic AI concepts to K-12 students. Currently, most K-12 AI research focuses on introducing fundamental AI concepts using pure virtual platforms like webpages or software. However, robots, as helpful and popular tools in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education, are infrequently used in K-12 AI education, and their role is not sufficiently explored. In this thesis, I introduced educational robots and integrated them with an online platform and an augmented reality interface to help students learn key concepts in reinforcement learning (RL). I chose RL because it is conceptually easy to understand but has received the least attention in previous research on teaching AI to K-12 students. We designed a series of activities in which students can design their own robots and train them with RL to finish a variety of tasks. The activities and platforms were tested with two groups of high school students. Twenty students' engagement and learning results were assessed through qualitative analyses of their behavior and discussions by me and the class instructors. The role of robots and virtual platforms in motivating students and facilitating their learning was also discussed. The result showed that students were able to understand both high-level AI concepts and specific RL terms through our activities. Many students can even construct a deeper understanding of some of the RL concepts than we expected. Also, our approach of combining virtual platforms and physical robots provided students with an interactive and engaging learning experience. The implementation of robots inspired students' curiosity and solution diversity in resolving RL problems, while the integration of virtual platforms helped demystify key concepts of RL and enabled students to construct a deeper understanding of RL by providing them with an intuitive way to collaborate with their robots.

"UAKISI5F","thesis","2022","Suresh, Abhijit","Automating Feedback to Improve Teachers' Effective Use of Instructional Discourse in K-12 Mathematics Classrooms","","","","","","Over the past decade, robust literature focused on teacher ""talk moves"" that promote student argumentation has emerged, especially in mathematics education. Teachers and students can use talk moves to construct conversations in which students share their thinking, actively consider the ideas of others, and engage in sustained reasoning. Providing teachers with detailed feedback about the talk moves utilized in their lessons requires considerable human expertise. These highly trained observers must hand-code transcripts of classroom recordings, analyze talk moves and provide one-on-one expert coaching, a time-consuming and expensive process. Our research team developed Talkback - an innovative application to address a significant challenge in education: providing teachers with immediate and actionable feedback on their use of effective classroom discourse strategies. My work is situated in the research and development of a cyberinfrastructure for TalkBack, including deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated feedback. Starting with a bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) network, I explore different state-of-the-art deep learning models, including transformers, to automatically analyze classroom recordings and generate information about classroom discourse strategies with F1 measures up to 78.92%. The TalkMoves dataset used for training and evaluating these models was curated by an interdisciplinary research team and comprised 500+ human-annotated classroom transcripts. The strong performance of both the student and the teacher talk moves models illustrates the reliability and robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to noisy real-world classroom data. TalkBack application serves as an example to support a well-specified theory of learning (accountable talk), addresses a recognized challenge in education (teacher feedback), and has the potential to scale to large classrooms and teachers. The ability to better understand teachers' perceptions and use of the TalkBack application can provide structured professional learning opportunities that promote discourse-rich pedagogy. Results from a mixed-methods study with teachers highlight several emergent themes relating to the perceived utility of TalkBack as an AI-based tool and serving as a platform for research and innovations in NLP and education.

We evaluate VLMs on teachers' QA pairs, as well as 44,362 synthetic QA pairs derived from teachers' descriptions using language models (LMs). We show that even state-of-the-art VLMs leave much room for improvement on DrawEduMath questions.

Although previous studies have produced mixed findings on the influence of the metaverse on perceptions and academic achievement of online and blended STEM learning, it is necessary to study the overall impact of the metaverse on K-12 students' STEM learning and how the related factors, such as technologies used, pedagogical approaches, learners' education levels, and domains of learning, modulate STEM learning outcomes. Therefore, the study applied a meta-analysis method to assess the influence of the metaverse on K-12 students' academic achievement and perceptions of STEM in online and blended learning settings, while also examining the moderating effects in 49 studies. The effect sizes for academic achievement and perceptions were estimated to be 0.821 (indicating a great impact) and 0.575 (indicating a moderate impact), respectively. The moderation analysis showed that the learning domains and learners' education level were significant moderators of the influence of the metaverse on their academic achievement, with elementary students showing greater improvement in science subjects. Moreover, the technologies used and pedagogical approaches played a pivotal role as moderators in shaping students' perceptions of the impact of the metaverse, with VR and AR technologies and inquiry-based learning being particularly effective in terms of enhancing learner perceptions. Thus, it is recommended for teachers to actively utilize the metaverse for STEM teaching, while considering their students' educational level, learning domain, appropriate technology use, and pedagogical approaches.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","111-143","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1455055","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1455055","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; Technology Uses in Education; Educational Technology; Technological Advancement; STEM Education; Computer Simulation; Online Courses; Academic Achievement; Blended Learning; Student Attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"6I435WZH","report","2024","Barnes, Tiffany; Burriss, Sarah; Danish, Joshua; Finkelstein, Samantha; Humburg, Megan; Limke, Ally; Molvig, Ole; Reichert, Heidi","Toward Ethical and Just AI in Education Research","","","","","","Research and development work in artificial intelligence in education (AIED) is wide ranging and rapidly growing to support all areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning. At the risk of hyperbole, this is potentially the most fundamentally game-changing technology for education to emerge since the internet. Building from decades of work on AI and AI-based learning and teaching technologies, the recent advances in AIED are pushing us to reimagine what is possible for STEM teaching and learning. AIED research initiatives are being speedily funded, and AIED advances are quickly becoming integrated into STEM education. It is transforming how teachers teach and how students learn. It is also transforming how education developers and researchers conduct their expansive work. There is excitement about the promise of AIED as well as growing concern that the breakthroughs in AIED are impacting everyday education practice in ways that may perpetuate long-standing biases and diminish the potential for positive outcomes. This brief is the first in a three-part series on AIED related to STEM research, teaching, and learning. The topics address ethical approaches to AI in STEM education research, AI for STEM teaching, and AI for STEM learning. This series is sponsored by the Community for Advancing Discovery Research in Education (CADRE), a National Science Foundation-funded network for STEM education researchers endeavoring to improve STEM teaching and learning through research, development, and various information-sharing and community-building mechanisms. Researchers in the CADRE network are part of a portfolio of projects funded through NSF's Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program. The DRK-12 portfolio is wide-ranging, with a multitude of projects that focus on applied research and development to generate innovative research-informed and field-tested tools, products, and approaches that are intended to enhance STEM teaching and learning. Over the past several years, the portfolio has grown to include an increasing number of projects that leverage AIED to achieve their goals related to teaching or learning. It is expected to continue to grow. This series has been inspired by the question, ""What are the essential considerations for researchers and developers who are designing, studying, and using AI in K-12 STEM?"" Our hope is that the opportunities and challenges discussed in this series will generate reflection and rich discussion for the better and support the transformative use of AI to achieve positive and wide-reaching impact for all learners. In this first brief, ""Toward Ethical and Just AI in Education Research,"" the authors are concerned with the ethical reasoning and decisions made in the development, study, and use of AIED technologies. Recognizing that AIED technologies reflect both the intended and unintended biases of the designers and the wider society, they advocate for the adoption of policies and practices that prioritize ethics, equity, and justice in research and development initiatives using AIED technologies in K-12 education. In an effort to provide guidance to researchers and developers, they lay the groundwork for responsible AI research and its implementation in educational settings. This foundation draws in part from the ethics rules for research with human subjects that have guided researchers for decades, but goes beyond this to frame a more all-encompassing stance rooted in justice and equity. The authors illustrate how ethical AI research can be strengthened by building from well-established ethical principles used in research and society at large. Taking into account these principles, they propose an ethical AIED framework and a set of tools that they have found to be supportive of continuous reflection, communication, and improvement toward inclusive and equitable AIED research and development. Their guidance is in the service of ensuring that the good intentions of researchers and developers will lead to positive design decisions and actions that create inclusive AIED technology products and systems. This is a valuable contribution that encourages a shift in focus to bring ethics, justice, and the values of communities of teachers, students, and families to the forefront of research and development practice.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community for Advancing Discovery Research in Education (CADRE)","","","","","","","","","ERIC Number: ED655704","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED655704","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; Technology Uses in Education; Educational Research; STEM Education; Teaching Methods; Inclusion; Ethics; Equal Education; Justice; Learning Experience; Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States. Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups. Implications: The findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings.","2025","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1458977","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1458977","Artificial Intelligence; Technology Uses in Education; Mathematics Achievement; Individualized Instruction; Computer Software; Cognitive Processes; Grade 8; Learner Engagement; Middle School Mathematics; Middle School Students; Rural Areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme ""Mathematics and AI"" which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Association for Development of the Information Society","","","","","","","","","ERIC Number: ED626868","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED626868","Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Education; Teacher Attitudes; Elementary School Teachers; Secondary School Teachers; STEM Education; Learning Activities; Didacticism; Educational Practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4WKYXCAH","thesis","2024","Delaney, Victoria Leah","The Mathematics of Facial Recognition: Statistics Teachers' Adaptations to a Machine Learning Curriculum","","","","","","Today's students are surrounded by machine learning (ML)-powered tools. Yet, few understand how they work. While there are numerous opportunities for students to learn about ML in informal settings (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2022; Druga et al., 2022) and online (e.g., code.org, Scratch), there are far fewer opportunities in the United States for students to learn about how ML works while they are in school. Although curriculum and standards frameworks have been developed to help educators navigate machine learning education, it is not yet known if teachers can or want to enact ML curriculum in their practice. As a former classroom teacher and ML graduate student, I saw interdisciplinary commonalities between machine learning and statistics, the subject I used to teach. In response, I co-designed a one-unit curriculum, ""The Math of Facial Recognition"" (""FaceID""), with a practicing high school teacher. We built the curriculum with three goals: (1) that it would aim to help teachers and students build high-level intuitions about ML, (2) that it would draw from teachers' and students' prior statistics knowledge, and (3) that it would bridge statistics and ML concepts by exploring facial recognition in smartphones, a ML application that students likely use everyday. We built custom web applications, termed ""widgets,"" with the purpose of enabling students to explore and test hypotheses about facial recognition using images of themselves. Finally, we designed the curriculum with features that intentionally encouraged statistics teachers to adapt segments and activities of lessons for their students. That teachers would adapt a curriculum for instruction is not surprising; in fact, it is an expected component of good teaching. Drawing from studies in curriculum theory, I argue that teachers' adaptations of curriculum - from written documents, to teacher-intended curricula, to jointly-enacted curricula between teachers and students - are supported by their pedagogical design capacity (PDC) (Brown, 2009). In the context of my study, PDC refers to statistics teachers' diverse resources as designers of instruction: their statistics pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), subject-matter knowledge of statistics, students PCK, general knowledge of pedagogy, and their goals. Teachers' goals may or may not align with goals stated in the written curriculum, which can influence their adaptations. Two key goals of this work are to investigate how teachers' PDC supported their ability to adapt ""FaceID,"" and to identify their rationales for making adaptations. To implement my study, I partnered with three experienced high school statistics teachers who agreed to enact ""FaceID"" in their classrooms. I observed each teacher's enactment, noting where and how teachers made adaptations. I interviewed each teacher before and after they taught the curriculum to learn about their prior knowledge, experiences, goals, and post-implementation, the nature of their adaptations. I also asked each teacher to identify their adaptations separately in a reflection document, because I was curious to understand how teachers defined an ""adaptation"" in their own practice. After concluding my field work, I analyzed the data to determine what adaptations teachers made to ""FaceID"" and their rationales for adapting segments and activities, taking note of instances where teachers interpreted their adaptations differently than the researchers.

After discussing theoretical frameworks on strategies of problem solving and phases of the critical thinking process, we present six problems of combinatorics that we submitted to ChatGPT. We also asked 40 university students to solve the six problems in group with the aid of ChatGPT during an international module on Problem Solving and Critical Thinking and collected the tutors' observations about the activities. Analyzing ChatGPT solutions and tutors' reflections, we show that the proposed activity requires problem solving and critical thinking to be accomplished. The results corroborate the idea that, instead of limiting the use of AI in education, it is possible to integrate it within learning and assessment to achieve the learning goals.

Thus, this study combined machine learning with traditional statistics to identify the most important predictors and to interpret their effects on proficiency in the PISA 2018 mathematics, science, and reading tests. Predictors encompassed a wide range of variables, sociodemographic characteristics, teaching and learning processes, and non-cognitive skills. The outcome of the present study was proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. PISA proficiency levels were grouped into ""low proficiency"" and ""proficient"" categories, using a classification system commonly employed in PISA reports. Using random forest analysis, a machine learning method, I compared the importance of predictors for proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. I then adjusted multilevel logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the top predictors and the outcomes. Among the top predictors for the three outcomes identified, annual household income, parents' highest occupational status, and early childhood education and care were positively associated with proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading, while grade repetition and additional instruction were negatively associated with these outcomes. These findings urge Brazilian policymakers and educators to prioritize initiatives that strengthen early childhood programs, minimize grade repetition, and promote effective learning strategies.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:39","2025-05-02 01:52:39","","927-954","","8","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1446448","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1446448","Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; Predictor Variables; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Reading Achievement; Science Achievement; Statistical Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High school dropout prediction serves as a case study for examining human-machine collaboration's efficacy. Unlike previous research prioritizing high accuracy with immutable predictors, this study seeks to bridge gaps by identifying actionable factors for dropout prediction through a framework of human--machine collaboration. Utilizing a large dataset from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), two machine learning models were developed to predict 9th-grade students' high school dropout history. Results indicated that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the deep learning algorithm. Model explainability revealed the significance of actionable variables such as students' GPA in the 9th grade, sense of school belonging, self-efficacy in mathematics and science, and immutable variables like socioeconomic status in predicting high school dropout history.

"RKV8DI78","report","2021","Jimenez, Laura; Boser, Ulrich","The Way Forward for State Standardized Tests. Future of Testing in Education","","","","","","Federal law requires all public school students in grades three to eight to take an annual assessment in reading and math at the end of the year and requires students to take an assessment once during high school. The goal of this assessment is to measure the extent to which all students are meeting the state's academic standards. These standards must align with the knowledge and skills in reading and math that students need to succeed in first-year college reading and math courses. Ensuring all students are held to rigorous standards is a key goal of equity in education. Yet many question the value of yearly standardized testing in schools since the opportunity to receive a high-quality education and graduate high school adequately prepared for college-level academics is still wholly inequitable. Students who are Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic graduate high school at lower rates than their white peers, and they require catch-up coursework in college more often. What is more, the costs and time associated with assessments, delayed results, and failure of tests alone to improve students' academic results leave many to wonder if they are worth the effort at best, and at worst, if they harm students and punish teachers and schools. Still, there are ways to design an assessment to reduce the amount of time it takes to administer, ensure that it collects information about students throughout the year, or base the test on performing tasks. This report describes the advancements in testing technology that make such assessments possible, and it concludes with recommended changes in federal testing policy to make the use of these designs effective. This report is part three in a series about the future of testing in America's schools. Part one of the series ""Effective and Equitable Assessment Systems. Future of Testing in Education"" (ED617053) presents a theory of action that assessments should play in schools. Part two ""Artificial Intelligence.

A lot of research in mathematics education research focus on the analysis on the linguistic complexity based on theoretical build language dimensions. To date, however it has been unclear what empirical relationship between the linguistic features exist for mathematical word problems. To address this issue, we used unsupervised ML techniques to reveal latent linguistic structures of 17 linguistic features for 342 mathematical word problems and classify them. The models showed that threeand five-dimensional linguistic structures have the highest explanatory power. Additionally, the authors consider a four-dimensional solution. Mathematical word problem from the three-dimensional solution can be classify in two groups, three- and five-dimensional solutions in three groups. The findings revealed latent linguistic structures and groups that could have an implication of the linguistic complexity of mathematical word problems and differ from language dimensions, which are considered theoretically. Therefore, the results indicate for new design principles for interventions and materials for language education in mathematics learning and teaching.","2023","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1379131","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1379131","Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Teaching Methods; Classification; Learning Processes; Barriers; Difficulty Level; Intervention; Models; Word Problems (Mathematics); Secondary School Students; Problem Solving; Academic Language; Computational Linguistics; Correlation; Factor Analysis; Instructional Design; Language Usage; Textbooks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Systematic Review of Media Comparison Studies Involving Immersive Virtual Reality for STEM Education","Educational Psychology Review","","1573-336X","","","A substantial amount of media comparison research has been conducted in the last decade to investigate whether students learn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content better in immersive virtual reality (IVR) or more traditional learning environments. However, a thorough review of the design and implementation of conventional and IVR conditions in media comparison studies has not been conducted to examine the extent to which specific affordances of IVR can be pinpointed as the causal factor in enhancing learning. The present review filled this gap in the literature by examining the degree to which conventional and IVR conditions have been controlled on instructional methods and content within the K-12 and higher education STEM literature base. Thirty-eight published journal articles, conference proceedings, and dissertations related to IVR comparison studies in STEM education between the years 2013 and 2022 were coded according to 15 categories. These categories allowed for the extraction of information on the instructional methods and content characteristics of the conventional and IVR conditions to determine the degree of control within each experimental comparison. Results indicated only 26% of all comparisons examined between an IVR and conventional condition were fully controlled on five key control criteria. Moreover, 40% of the comparisons had at least one confound related to instructional method and content. When looking at the outcomes of the studies, it was difficult to gather a clear picture of the benefits or pitfalls of IVR when much of the literature was confounded and/or lacked sufficient information to determine if the conditions were controlled on key variables. Implications and recommendations for future IVR comparison research are discussed.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1429662","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1429662","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; STEM Education; Teaching Methods; Comparative Analysis; Higher Education; Course Content; Mass Media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering.","2021-07","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","572-593","","3","110","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1304066","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1304066","Mathematics Achievement; High School Students; Predictor Variables; Majors (Students); Longitudinal Studies; Gender Differences; Engineering Education; Class Rank; Demography; Science Interests; Student Characteristics; Student Interests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EdWorkingPaper No. 24-1054","","","","","","Generative AI, particularly Language Models (LMs), has the potential to transform real-world domains with societal impact, particularly where access to experts is limited. For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately hurts students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education and are most likely to be taught by inexperienced educators. We introduce Tutor CoPilot, a novel Human-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study presents the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working on mathematics with tutors randomly assigned to have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. relative to the control group. We find that Tutor CoPilot costs only $20 per-tutor annually, based on the tutors' usage during the study. We analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use strategies that foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student, aligning with high-quality teaching practices. Tutor interviews qualitatively highlight how Tutor CoPilot's guidance helps them to respond to student needs, though tutors flag common issues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, our study of Tutor CoPilot demonstrates how Human-AI systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students.

"EYJ782ZY","thesis","2020","Zhang, Ningyu","Supporting the Integrated Learning of Science, Engineering, and Computational Thinking in an Open-Ended Learning Environment","","","","","","Recently there has been a call among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers for the integration of science and engineering education in K-12 curricula. Similarly, computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a framework for developing computer literacy and computing skills among the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) communities. Meanwhile, open-ended learning environments (OELEs) and artificial intelligence methods are being used extensively to facilitate meaningful and personalized learning. This study investigates the effectiveness of an OELE to support middle school students' integrated learning of science, engineering, and CT. Using a principled domain-specific modeling language, we designed and implemented an OELE and an earth sciences curriculum that supports this form of integrated learning. CT concepts and practices are instantiated through computational modeling activities, where students build computational models of the runoff phenomenon in urban environments and then use the developed models to solve an engineering task of designing a schoolyard to minimize water runoff while also satisfying the design criteria of cost and accessibility. A teacher-led classroom study was run with 99 sixth-grade students, and the data collected consists of students' summative and formative assessments, as well as log data of their activities on the OELE. Our results show that (1) the participants achieved significant learning gains in science, engineering design, and CT concepts and practices; (2) the participants' learning behaviors and performance across different domains influenced each other in a positive way; and (3) the participants' learning strategies can be linked to their learning performances. This work has made important advances to integrated science and engineering education. In future work, we plan to extend this curriculum and provide feedback within the OELE to help students become better learners.

The other aim was to identify the affordances and constraints of ChatGPT through the instrumental approach. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. The participants were 160 high school students and 80 mathematics teachers. Data were collected through the evaluation forms, view forms, and interviews with students and teachers based on ChatGPT's solutions to the mathematical problems. The findings showed that the success rates of GPT-4o and GPT-4 were close to each other, with a slightly higher success rate of GPT-4o. This was followed by MathGPT and GPT-3.5. Gemini has the lowest success rate among the AI chatbots. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical problems, a statistically significant difference between the number of correct and incorrect solutions was found in all ChatGPT versions but not in MathGPT and Gemini. Furthermore, teachers and students referred to explanatory and detailed aspects of the solutions, learning without a teacher, getting solutions directly and quickly, and learning support as affordances of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the participants also acknowledged the constraints of ChatGPT while being aware of its affordances. Based on students' and teachers' expressions in the view forms and interviews, the mean scores they provided in the evaluation forms, and ChatGPT's high performance in solving mathematical problems, it is suggested that ChatGPT could be a useful tool for students' individual mathematics learning process.","2025","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","509-545","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1457899","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1457899","Artificial Intelligence; Technology Uses in Education; Mathematics Education; Mathematics Teachers; High School Students; Secondary School Mathematics; Computer Software; High School Teachers; Problem Solving; Textbooks; Affordances; Electronic Books; Synchronous Communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the world becomes more uncertain and volatile due to impacts of artificial intelligence (AI), international unrest, climate change, global economic instability and unforeseen catastrophes such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to review, revise and refine school education curricula and policies. The issue of what is essential for students to learn, and how they learn it, is of growing importance to international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and is emerging as a significant driver for educational reform across the globe. The growing prominence of CT and DL skills across many industry sectors has prompted recent changes to international assessment frameworks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper will briefly discuss specific examples of alternative approaches to addressing CT in national curricula for the compulsory years of schooling and explain how CT has been adopted as a driver for mathematics curriculum change in Australia.","2023","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","41-55","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1381081","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1381081","Elementary Secondary Education; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Algorithms; Mathematics Achievement; Computer Science Education; Teaching Methods; Thinking Skills; Mathematics Tests; Educational Change; Learning Processes; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Science Achievement; Digital Literacy; Case Studies; International Organizations; Mathematics Curriculum; National Curriculum; Pattern Recognition; Science Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XB7LTHFP","thesis","2021","Kornyo, Emmanuel Anthony","Exploring the Use of Artificial Intelligent Systems in STEM Classrooms","","","","","","Human beings by nature have a predisposition towards learning and the exploration of the natural world. We are intrinsically intellectual and social beings knitted with adaptive cognitive architectures. As Foot (2014) succinctly sums it up: ""humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions"" and they ""… make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate"" and ""community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning--and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting"" (p.3). Education remains pivotal in the transmission of social values including language, knowledge, science, technology, and an avalanche of others. Indeed, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have been significant to the advancement of social cultures transcending every epoch to contemporary times. As Jasanoff (2004) poignantly observed, ""the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we choose to live in it. […] Scientific knowledge [..] both embeds and is embedded in social practices, identities, norms, conventions, discourses, instruments, and institutions"" (p.2-3). In essence, science remains both a tacit and an explicit cultural activity through which human beings explore their own world, discover nature, create knowledge and technology towards their progress and existence. This has been possible through the interaction and applications of artifacts, tools, and technologies within the purviews of their environments. The applications of technologies are found across almost every luster of organizational learning especially teacher education, STEM, architecture, manufacturing, and a flurry of others. Thus, human evolution and development are inexplicably linked with education either formally or informally. The 21st century has however seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in education. The proliferation of artificial intelligence and associated technologies are creating new overtures of digital multiculturalism with distinct worldviews of significance to education. For example, learners are demonstrating digital literacy skills and are knowledgeable about AI technologies across every specter of their lives (Bennett et al., 2008). It is also opening new artesian well-springs of educational opportunities and pedagogical applications. This includes mapping new methodological pathways, content creation and curriculum design, career preparations and indeed a seemingly new paradigm shift in teaching STEM. There is growing scholarly evidence about the use and diffusion of these technologies in K-12 and higher education (Bonk & Graham, 2012; Hew & Brush, 2007; Langer, 2018; Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Some of these include the Sphero robots, Micro Bit, Jill Watson, ""BrickPi3 Classroom kit"", ""Engino STEM Mechanic"", ""Lego Education WeDo Core Set"" and Spike. Both educators and learners are using these in STEM programs as well as other education related activities. Just as human activities and interactions with artifacts and tools shaped and redefined the scientific-technological feat of previous generations, so the contemporary digital technological era seems to be on a similar trajectory. However, there is sparsity of empirical scholarship on the pedagogical prospects and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms. Also, it should be noted that scholarship on how AI impacts pedagogical content knowledge of STEM educators and how learners perceive these technologies are just emerging. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Ghandhi et al., 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020) has unexpectedly created a renewed synergy towards the applications of digital technologies in teaching STEM. In the context of this ""force majeure"" (COVID-19), the traditional brick and mortar educational spaces metamorphosed into digital spaces with the applications of many artificial intelligent technologies and resources in the arena of education. This doctoral dissertation study examined these enigmas including how educators use these technologies in STEM classrooms. The study is informed by ""activity theory or cultural-historical activity theory"" (Engestro¨m et al., 2007; Hasan et al., 2014; Krinski & Barker, 2009; Oers, 2010; Vygotsky,1987). The study participants will be selected from educators currently integrating artificial intelligent systems and digital technologies in their respective STEM classrooms. Pre-data survey inquiry has shown that many educators were incorporating some forms of AIS into their STEM classrooms. In view of these, I have explored Sphero educational robots to interrogate the research topic. The Sphero Edu described as a ""…STEAM-based toolset that weaves hardware, software, and community engagement to promote 21st century skills. While these skills are absolutely crucial, our edu program goes beyond code by nurturing students' creativity and ingenuity like no other education program can"" (Sphero, April 2020). The Sphero robots also have features and applications for designing and teaching STEM topics such as nature, space science, geometry, and other activities of pedagogical significance. Users could also design and write advanced engineering programs in JavaScript during STEM educational activities formally and outside of the classrooms. In essence, educators and students can learn designing, programming, engineering, mathematics, computational thinking, and hands-on skills reflective of the 21st century. In brief, the dissertation study research has explored artificial intelligence and emerging technologies and how these could transform and advance teaching and learning of STEM hence the research topic: ""Exploring the use of Artificial Intelligent Systems in STEM Classrooms."" Methodologically, this is a qualitative study through the theoretical frameworks of ""activity theory"" as applicable to STEM education. The main research questions are: 1) ""Given that artificial intelligent systems and digital technologies"" have been applied in STEM educational domains (content, pedagogy, student learning, assessment). How does the application of AIS and digital technologies impact pedagogy in STEM educational activities? 2) Given that digital technology is transforming contemporary society in every facet. How/What does AIS tell us about how digital technology impacts STEM pedagogy? Data was collected from the study participants, archival sources, and others for analyses. It is hoped that the findings will inform and address theories of learning and teaching, policy and praxis in science education, teacher preparatory and professional development programs as it relates to STEM classrooms.

A machine learning approach (i.e., random forest) was employed to analyze a dataset of 519,334 15-year-old students from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. The global analysis identified 25 key factors out of 88 contextual features: (1) for ""how you think,"" making students feel science is relevant, enjoyable, and interesting is relatively more crucial than being ambitious and confident; (2) for ""what science you know,"" students' science and math literacy, epistemological beliefs, and awareness of environmental matters were the key factors; (3) for ""who you know,"" parents valuing science, expecting their children to enter science, and providing emotional support were as similar as or even more important than their economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS)-related constructs, while teachers fairness ranked the top among all teaching-related features; and (4) for ""what you do,"" appropriate science learning time, engagement in science activities, and ICT use for schoolwork were key factors. These findings indicate a relatively optimistic situation, as the most key capitals were malleable for educators. Accumulated local effect plots further discriminated how these key capitals related to students' career expectations in four distinct ways: ""increasing,"" ""S-shaped,"" ""inverted-U-shaped,"" and ""decreasing,"" shedding light on how we could optimize key resources to enhance aspirations. The comparison between global and Hong Kong analyses suggests the key factors identified by the global model were generally effective but not necessarily essential for a specific region. The cross-cultural generalizability or prevalence of capitals might vary by their forms.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","1975-2010","","8","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1449602","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1449602","Expectation; Foreign Countries; Student Attitudes; Learner Engagement; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Science Education; Teacher Student Relationship; Student Interests; Beliefs; Cross Cultural Studies; Epistemology; Multiple Literacies; Parent Student Relationship; Psychological Patterns; STEM Careers; Time on Task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance.

"R96XML3M","thesis","2021","Karakis, Nesibe","Predictors of Early Postsecondary STEM Persistence of High-Achieving Students: An Explanatory Study Using Machine Learning Techniques","","","","","","This study investigated high-achieving and non-high-achieving students' persistence in STEM fields using nationally representative data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 for the years 2009, 2012, 2013, 2013-2014, and 2016. The results indicated that approximately 70% of high-achieving and non-high-achieving students continued their initial STEM degrees within 3 years of college enrollment. The study revealed that the most important predictors of STEM persistence were: math proficiency level, school belonging, school engagement, school motivation, school problems, science self-efficacy, credits earned in computer sciences, GPA in STEM courses, credits earned in STEM courses, and credits earned in Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) courses. Based on the results, math proficiency was the most important variable in the study for both high-achieving and non-high-achieving students. Even though credits earned in AP/IB combined were among the most important variables, they were two times more important for high-achieving students (6.86% vs. 3.37%). Regarding demographic information related variables, socioeconomic status was the most important variable among gender, ethnicity, and urbanicity in models predicting STEM persistence and had higher importance for non-high-achieving students. Furthermore, Hispanic students' proportion of persistence differed from other underrepresented populations' persistence. Non-high-achieving Hispanic students had the highest persistence rate, similar to well-represented populations (i.e., White, Asian). Machine learning methods used in the study including random forest and artificial neural network provided good accuracy for both achievement groups. Random forest accuracy was over 82% with the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) dataset, while artificial neural network accuracy was over 92%.

One approach for making computing accessible and relevant to learning and problem-solving in K-12 environments is to integrate it with existing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) curricula. However, novice student learners may face several difficulties in trying to learn STEM and computing concepts simultaneously. To address some of these difficulties, we present a systematic approach to learning STEM and CT by designing and developing ""domain-specific modeling languages"" (DSMLs) to aid students in their model building and problem-solving processes. The paper discusses a theoretical framework and the design principles for developing DSMLs, which is implemented as a four-step process. We apply the four-step process in three domains: Physics, Marine Biology, and Earth Science to demonstrate its generality, and then perform case studies to show how the DSMLs impact student learning and model building.

"KF7X5EAI","report","2022","Lu, Yikai; Ober, Teresa M.; Liu, Cheng; Cheng, Ying","Application of Neighborhood Components Analysis to Process and Survey Data to Predict Student Learning of Statistics","","","","","","Machine learning methods for predictive analytics have great potential for uncovering trends in educational data. However, simple linear models still appear to be most widely used, in part, because of their interpretability. This study aims to address the issues of interpretability of complex machine learning classifiers by conducting feature extraction by neighborhood components analysis (NCA). Our dataset comprises 287 features from both process data indicators (i.e., derived from log data of an online statistics learning platform) and self-report data from high school students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics (N=733). As a label for prediction, we use students' scores on the AP Statistics exam. We evaluated the performance of machine learning classifiers with a given feature extraction method by evaluation criteria including F1 scores, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Cohen's Kappas. We find that NCA effectively reduces the dimensionality of training datasets, stabilizes machine learning predictions, and produces interpretable scores. However, interpreting the NCA weights of features, while feasible, is not very straightforward compared to linear regression. Future research should consider developing guidelines to interpret NCA weights.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Grantee Submission","","","","","","","","","ERIC Number: ED661382","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED661382","Educational Trends; Prediction; High School Students; Online Courses; Mathematics Tests; Statistics Education; Data Analysis; Advanced Placement; Data Interpretation; Evaluation Criteria; Guidelines; Learning Analytics; Learning Management Systems; Learning Problems; Scores; Trend Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to analyze and explore the mechanisms of the influence of noncognitive factors on 15-year-old students' abilities in China and the United States. Based on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 education dataset, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model identifies and explains the factors. The study finds that there are 11 most influential common features in China and 9 in the United States. The two countries have 5 common features, the meta-cognition assess credibility, summarizing text ability, PISA test difficulty perception, science learning time, and school lessons numbers per week. Family economic status also impacts personal ability. Regarding subject characteristics, attitude towards failure is the determinant of reading and mathematics. Cooperation and competition among students help to improve mathematics and science. Furthermore, the comparison between the two countries concludes that self-awareness, family economic status, and school learning environment are critical to personal ability. The study concludes that it is necessary to foster a sense of healthy competition among students at the school level and provide more attention to students with low family socioeconomic status to improve their abilities.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","575-593","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1363815","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1363815","Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; High School Students; Student Attitudes; Difficulty Level; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Reading Achievement; Science Achievement; Academic Ability; Educational Environment; Competition; Failure; Family Income; Influences; Low Income Students; Metacognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9LXYBENN","thesis","2022","Ng, Kevin Christopher","Essays in Labor Economics","","","","","","This dissertation is comprised of three essays, each examining a different topic in labor economics. In Chapter 1, I examine the productivity and selection effects of K-12 teacher tenure by leveraging variation from New Jersey's TEACHNJ Act. This law extended the pre-tenure period from three to four years and allowed districts to dismiss consistently low-performing teachers. I use multiple identification strategies to estimate the productivity effects of tenure across a teacher's career. I evaluate the productivity effects at tenure receipt using a difference-in-differences design, which compares fourth-year tenured and pre-tenured teachers. At tenure receipt, math value-added declines but English language arts value-added and summative ratings remain unchanged. To estimate the productivity effects later in the career, I use a regression discontinuity design relying on discontinuities in job security around summative rating thresholds. Later in the career, tenure has no impact on productivity. Thus, tenure induces a transitory decline in math value-added without impacting other dimensions of teacher performance. Focusing on the labor market effects, I compare teachers hired before and after TEACHNJ within the same district and experience level. The TEACHNJ Act disproportionately increased male and Black teacher turnover rates. TEACHNJ did not impact the quality of the teacher labor market as measured by value-added, though higher rated teachers often filled new vacancies. Since the TEACHNJ Act only relies on summative ratings to make personnel decisions, this result aligns with a multitask principal-agent model where only one of several measures of performance is used to evaluate the employee. In Chapter 2, I evaluate techniques to identify high-quality teachers. Since tenure restricts dismissals of experienced teachers, schools must predict productivity and dismiss those expected to perform ineffectively prior to tenure receipt. Many states solely rely on evaluation scores to guide these personnel decisions without considering other dimensions of teacher performance. For example, New Jersey uses summative ratings, which primarily rely on supervisor evaluations. I use various predictive models to rank teachers based on predicted value-added and summative ratings. I then simulate revised personnel decisions and test for changes in average retained teacher performance. In this exercise, I adjust two factors that impact the quality of the predictions: the number of predictors and the length of the pre-tenure period. Both factors impact the precision of the predictions, though extended pre-tenure periods also may negatively impact selection into teaching. I find that revised algorithms using both value-added and summative ratings increase the average value-added of retained teachers by 0.01 standard deviations without decreasing summative ratings or diversity. This Pareto improvement equates to a present value gain of $2,240 per student. These returns are a product of using additional information rather than advanced algorithms, as I generate similar gains when using simple ordinary least squares regressions or advanced machine learning techniques. In comparison, algorithms that extend the pre-tenure period beyond one year do not provide enough additional information to significantly improve average retained teacher performance unless dismissal rates increase dramatically. In Chapter 3, my coauthor and I examine how returns to enrolling in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs vary with students' academic preparation. We match data on STEM admissions at a Colombian flagship university to nationwide college and earnings records. Our identification strategy combines a regression discontinuity design with variation in admission quotas. We find that less-prepared students were less likely to complete a STEM degree than their more able peers, but they had larger earnings returns to enrolling. Our results suggest that policies that encourage less-prepared students to enroll in STEM programs can yield large but unevenly distributed earnings gains.

However, current literature suggests that leveraging technology, such as calculators and AI, in mathematics education can enhance students' proficiency, particularly in the pre-calculus domain. Thus, this research study examined the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing Filipino students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. A quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was used, with 49 Grade 11 students from NEUST Laboratory High School participating. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to examine the pre-and post-intervention data. Results revealed a significant increase in students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus following the use of Photomath. The mean scores on all three measures increased significantly from the pretest to the posttest. The results of the t-tests further confirmed the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. These results suggest that Photomath can be a valuable tool for educators to incorporate into pre-calculus teaching to enhance students' confidence and interest, foster intrinsic motivation, and ultimately improve their performance.","2023","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","758-775","","6","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1409630","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1409630","Artificial Intelligence; Technology Uses in Education; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Education; High School Students; Self Efficacy; Computer Oriented Programs; Student Interests; Calculus; Grade 11; Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents a flexible way to combine statistics and machine learning for data analysis of a large-scale educational survey. The authors used statistical and machine learning methods to explore German students' attitudes towards information and communication technology (ICT) in relation to mathematical and scientific literacy measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2015 and 2018. Implementations of the random forest (RF) algorithm were applied to impute missing data and to predict students' proficiency levels in mathematics and science. Hierarchical linear models (HLM) were built to explore relationships between attitudes towards ICT and mathematical and scientific literacy with the focus on the nested structure of the data. ICT autonomy was an important variable in RF models, and associations between this attitude and literacy scores in HLM were significant and positive, while for other ICT attitudes the associations were negative (ICT in social interaction) or non-significant (ICT competence and ICT interest). The need for further research on ICT autonomy is discussed, and benefits of combining statistical and machine learning approaches are outlined.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","180-199","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1340662","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1340662","Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; Prediction; Student Attitudes; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Science Achievement; Student Characteristics; Information Technology; Programming Languages; Learning Analytics; Likert Scales; Numeracy; Personal Autonomy; Scientific Literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","1471-1485","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1422370","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1422370","Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics Instruction; Natural Language Processing; Lesson Plans; Prompting; Problem Solving; Instructional Design; Evaluation; High Schools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these systems have been shown to be effective under certain conditions, they can be difficult to integrate into pedagogical practices. In this paper, we introduce three group formation algorithms that leverage learning data from the adaptive intelligent tutoring system ALEKS to support pedagogical and collaborative learning practices with ALEKS. Each grouping method was devised for different use cases, but they all utilize a fine-grained multidimensional view of student ability measured across several hundred skills in an academic course. As such, the grouping algorithms not only identify groups of students, but they also determine what areas of ALEKS content each group should focus on. We then evaluate each of the three methods against two alternative baseline methods, which were chosen for their plausibility of being used in practice--one that groups students randomly and one that groups students based on a unidimensional course score. To evaluate these methods, we establish a set of practical metrics based on what we anticipate teachers would care about in practice. Evaluations were performed by simulating mock groupings of students at different time periods for real ALEKS algebra classes that occurred between 2017 and 2019. We show that each devised method obtains more favorable results on the specified metrics than the alternative methods under each use-case. Moreover, we highlight examples where our methods lead to more nuanced groupings than grouping based on a unidimensional measure of ability.","2023","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","843-884","","4","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1404295","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1404295","Elementary Secondary Education; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Algebra; Algorithms; Individualized Instruction; Ability Grouping; Grouping (Instructional Purposes)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning embodies a range of flexible statistical procedures to identify key indicators of a response variable among a collection of hundreds or even thousands of potential predictor variables. Among these, penalized regression approaches, including least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) and elastic net (Enet), have been advanced as useful tools capable of handling large number of predictors for variable selection for model generation. While the utility of penalized regression within educational research is emerging, less application of these machine learning methods, including random forest, to predictor variable selection in large-scale international data appears in the literature. In response, this study compared LASSO, Enet, and random forest for predictor variable selection, including the traditional forward stepwise (FS) regression approach, for students' test anxiety or, more specifically, schoolwork-related anxiety based on PISA 2015 data. Prediction of the three machine learning methods were compared for variable selection of 188 indicators of schoolwork-related anxiety. Data were based on US students (N = 5593) who participated in PISA 2015. With the exception of FS, LASSO, Enet, and random forest were iterated 100 times to consider the bias resulting from data-splitting to determine the selection or non-selection of each predictor. This resulted in the reporting of number of selected variables into the following five count categories: 1 or more, 25 or more, 50 or more, 75 or more, and all 100 iterations. LASSO and Enet both outperformed random forest but did not differ from one another in terms of prediction performance in 100 iterations of modeling. Correspondingly, LASSO was compared to FS in which, of the 188 predictors, 27 were identified as key indicators of schoolwork-related anxiety across 100 iterations, and 26 variables were also statistically significant with FS regression. Aligned with previous research, key indicators included personal, situational, and mathematics and reading achievement. Further, LASSO identified 28 variables (14.89%) statistically unrelated to schoolwork-related anxiety, which included indicators aligned to students' academic- and non-academic behaviors. LASSO and Enet outperformed random forest and yielded comparable results in which determinants of schoolwork-related anxiety included personal and environmental factors, including achievement goals, sense of belonging, and confidence to explain scientific phenomenon. LASSO and FS also identified similar predictor variables related, as well as unrelated, to schoolwork-related anxiety. Aligned with previous research, females reported higher schoolwork-related anxiety than males. Mathematics achievement was negatively related to anxiety, whereas reading performance was positively associated with anxiety. This study also bears significance as one of the first penalized regression studies to incorporate sampling weights and reflect the complex sampling schemes of large-scale educational assessment data.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1360264","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1360264","Artificial Intelligence; Educational Technology; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; Prediction; Self Efficacy; Predictor Variables; Gender Differences; Secondary School Students; Reading Achievement; Correlation; Student Characteristics; Anxiety; Context Effect; Environmental Influences; Goal Orientation; Student Behavior; Student School Relationship; Test Anxiety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, creating strategies for improving mathematics learning in students is a major goal of education research. However, doing so requires an ability to look at many aspects of mathematics learning, such as demographics and psychological dispositions, in an integrated way as part of the same system. Large-scale assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) provide an accessible and large volume of coherent data, and this gives researchers the opportunity to employ data-driven approaches to gain an overview of the system. For these reasons, we have used machine learning to explore the relationships between psychological dispositions and mathematical literacy in Australian 15-year-olds using the PISA 2012 data set. Our results from this strongly data-driven approach re-affirm the primacy of mathematics self-efficacy and highlight novel complex interactions between mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and socio-economic status.

Recently, educational researchers have investigated virtual environments in order to utilize the learning-by-teaching pedagogy. In a face-to-face learning-by-teaching situation, the role of the learners is to teach their peers or instructors. In virtual environments, learners take an active role by teaching a computer agent, which is referred to as Teachable Agent (TA). Although the current TA systems have shown their effectiveness on students' learning, there are some challenges associated with learner-computer interaction methods. One of the most popular interaction methods between the learner and the system is a concept map approach. The learner teaches TA by creating information structures by drawing and editing their concept map. However, the learner can teach TA rather constrained topics, such as concept-related materials or causal effects. It is difficult for TA systems to be utilized in different types of learning along with concept-related areas. Therefore, new approaches or methods for communication between a human learner and TA systems are required. This project aims to suggest a virtual learning-by-teaching environment. A communication method (i.e., a symbol manipulation approach) was adopted in this system. The method facilitates the interaction between the learner and the computer agent, specifically for K-12 students' mathematics learning. The design and development process is described, and future research areas are discussed.","2017","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","176-190","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1137860","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1137860","Artificial Intelligence; Computer Assisted Instruction; Elementary Secondary Education; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Educational Technology; Mathematics Education; Man Machine Systems; Computer Simulation; Instructional Effectiveness; Concept Mapping; Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. ""Science identity"" has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students' science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results: Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach's alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions: Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student's standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students' science identity.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1334332","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1334332","STEM Education; High School Students; Academic Persistence; Self Concept; Attitude Measures; Test Construction; Test Reliability; Test Validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guided by Jerome Bruner's constructivism and Lev Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, we designed and developed a chatbot that incorporates scaffolding strategies and social-emotional considerations, and we integrated it into ASSISTments, an online math learning platform. We conducted an experimental study to examine the influence of learning math with the chatbot compared to traditional learning with hints. This study involved 85 middle and high school students from three diverse school settings in the United States. The results revealed no significant differences in students' math learning performance and perceived helpfulness and interest between the chatbot and traditional hints conditions. However, students in the chatbot condition displayed significantly lower confidence in solving a similar problem after the intervention, likely due to the removal of the high level of support provided by the chatbot. Despite this, students' open responses indicated that a significantly higher number of students had positive attitudes towards chatbots. They appreciated the chatting feature, breaking down a problem into steps, and real-time support.

Despite these advancements, AI-powered automated scoring in international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) remains largely unexplored due to the scoring challenges associated with processing large amounts of multilingual responses. However, due to their low-stakes nature, ILSAs are an ideal ground for innovations and exploring new methodologies. Methods: This study proposes combining state-of-the-art machine translations (i.e., Google Translate & ChatGPT) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mitigate two key concerns of human scoring: inconsistency and high expense. We applied AI-based automated scoring to multilingual student responses from eight countries and six different languages, using six constructed response items from TIMSS 2019. Results: Automated scoring displayed comparable performance to human scoring, especially when the ANNs were trained and tested on ChatGPT-translated responses. Furthermore, psychometric characteristics derived from machine scores generally exhibited similarity to those obtained from human scores. These results can be considered as supportive evidence for the validity of automated scoring for survey assessments. Conclusions: This study highlights that automated scoring integrated with the recent machine translation holds great promise for consistent and resource-efficient scoring in ILSAs.","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:40","2025-05-02 01:52:40","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1420403","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1420403","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; Technology Uses in Education; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; Automation; Mathematics Tests; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Science Achievement; Science Tests; Scoring; Measurement; Multilingualism; Translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of this work has been funded through Education Technology research topics of NCER and NCSER and the Institute's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program run by NCER. Both centers also support projects focusing on education technology through other research topic areas, including programs such as Cognition and Student Learning, Early Learning Programs and Policies, Math and Science, Reading and Writing, Social and Behavioral Context, Improving Education Systems, and Effective Teachers and Teaching. Together, researchers funded by NCER and NCSER have developed or studied more than 270 web-based tools, 85 virtual environments and interactive simulations, 95 intelligent tutor and artificial intelligence software systems, 50 game-based tools, and 105 computer-based assessments. This compendium organizes information on the education technology projects sponsored by NCER and NCSER into three main sections: (1) Technology to Support Student Learning (in which the target of the project was students themselves or their families); (2) Technology to Support Teachers and Instructional Practice; and (3) Technology to Support Research and School Improvement. Within each section, projects are sorted into chapters based on content area, grade level, and intended outcome. In determining the chapters, the authors considered the National Education Technology Plan (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology 2010, 2016). Because projects may have multiple foci (e.g., supporting student learning and supporting teachers), some projects were assigned to multiple sections.

In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers' attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students' attitude towards school.

About 70 countries use TIMSS trend data for monitoring the effectiveness of their education systems in a global context, and more countries join TIMSS with each subsequent assessment cycle. Because it marks the successful transition to its first fully digital assessment cycle, TIMSS 2023 is a watershed cycle in the 28 year history of TIMSS. Half the TIMSS countries pioneered the transition to digital assessment in TIMSS 2019 paving the way for an ""all digital"" turning point in TIMSS 2023. Capitalizing on the benefits of technological advances is necessary for TIMSS to remain in sync with global realities, and TIMSS 2023 will set the wheels in motion to improve the quality of TIMSS data, increase efficiency in data collection, and make the data more useful. To provide deeper insights into how students approach mathematics and science assessment tasks, solve problems, and communicate their responses, TIMSS 2023 will include more complex and innovative item types that capture both responses and process indicators. A digital item designer and translation system will support TIMSS 2023 item development, enabling interactive opportunities and provision of various digital tools for students to use in developing and providing their responses. The idea of Problem Solving and Inquiry (PSI) Tasks introduced in TIMSS 2019 (ED596167) will be further developed. PSI tasks are based on attractive, interactive scenarios that allow students to follow a series of steps toward a solution or goal. A variety of PSI tasks will be integrated into the mathematics and science assessments.

"AHSSKA9F","journalArticle","2016","Koedinger, Kenneth R.; Aleven, Vincent","An Interview Reflection on ""Intelligent Tutoring Goes to School in the Big City""","International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","","1560-4292","","","Our 1997 article in ""IJAIED"" reported on a study that showed that a new algebra curriculum with an embedded intelligent tutoring system (the Algebra Cognitive Tutor) dramatically enhanced high-school students' learning. The main motivation for the study was to demonstrate that intelligent tutors that have cognitive science research embedded in them could have real impact in schools. This study was one of the first large-scale classroom evaluations of the integrated use of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in high schools. A core challenge was figuring out how to embed this new technology into a curriculum and into the existing social context of schools. A key element of the study design was to include multiple kinds of assessments, including standardized test items and items measuring complex problem solving and use of representations. The results were powerful: ""On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on standardized tests and 100% on tests targeting the [course] objectives."" We suggested that the study was evidence ""that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools."" Since this study, many more classroom studies comparing instruction that includes an ITS against business as usual have been conducted, often showing advantages for the ITS-enhanced curricula. More rigorous randomized field trials are now more commonplace, but the approach of using multiple assessments in large-scale randomized field trials has not caught on. Cognitive task analysis will remain fundamental to the success of ITSs. A key remaining question for ITS is to find out how they can be used most effectively to support open-ended problem solving, either online or offline. Given all the recent excitement around Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is interesting to note that our field of Artificial Intelligence in Education has been making huge, less recognized, progress with impact on millions of students and with the majority of those students finishing the course!","2016-03","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","13-24","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1091333","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1091333","Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Technology Uses in Education; Educational Technology; Algebra; Mathematics Achievement; Student Evaluation; Teaching Methods; Secondary School Mathematics; Mathematics Skills; Comparative Analysis; Instructional Effectiveness; Problem Solving; Standardized Tests; Control Groups; Scores; High Schools; Cognitive Science; Experimental Groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automatic Modeling of Collaborative Problem Solving Skills from Student Speech in the Wild","","","","","","We investigated the feasibility of using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to classify collaborative problem solving (CPS) skills from recorded speech in noisy environments. We analyzed data from 44 dyads of middle and high school students who used videoconferencing to collaboratively solve physics and math problems (35 and 9 dyads in school and lab environments, respectively). Trained coders identified seven cognitive and social CPS skills (e.g., sharing information) in 8,660 utterances. We used a state-of-the-art deep transfer learning approach for NLP, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), with a special input representation enabling the model to analyze adjacent utterances for contextual cues. We achieved a micro-average AUROC score (across seven CPS skills) of 0.80 using ASR transcripts, compared to 0.91 for human transcripts, indicating a decrease in performance attributable to ASR error. We found that the noisy school setting introduced additional ASR error, which reduced model performance (micro-average AUROC of 0.78) compared to the lab (AUROC = 0.83). We discuss implications for real-time CPS assessment and support in schools.

Quality and purposeful assessment can assist in students' learning and their achievement. While there has been a rapid growth in international, standardized student assessments in the past few decades, a large number of education systems participating in these assessments are now focusing their attention on developing new national, within-country assessments to evaluate educational standards and to modify the curriculum to better suit to the demands of the 21st century. Education systems that are successful in linking the national curriculum and assessments directly to international standards are performing better on international standardized assessments of reading, mathematics, and science. This book covers studies related to educational assessment in addressing quality of education and performance improvement. The book presents the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in assessment processes in various educational settings.

To this end, the multiple-choice item responses in the Booklet-11 Mathematics subtest at the 8th grade level in the TIMSS 2015 Turkey sample dataset were used to determine the cut-off score for the achievement test. The item responses in the ""Students Like Learning Mathematics Scale"" in the TIMSS 2015 8th grade Mathematics Student Questionnaire were used to determine the cut-off score for the scale. The data were accessed from the TIMSS international database and the data were analyzed in MATLAB R2017b software. As a result of the study, the most appropriate cut-off score to be used for the evaluation of the total scores obtained from the TIMSS 2015 8th grade level Booklet-11 Mathematics subtest was determined as 45.5 out of 0-100 points with the Artificial Neural Network analysis method. The overall level of agreement between the cut-off score and the pass/fail classification based on 400 points, which is the lowest level of the TIMSS International Benchmark, was determined as 81%. The most appropriate cut-off score to be used for the evaluation of the scores obtained from the Students Like Learning Mathematics Scale (SLLSS) in the TIMSS 2015 8th grade student survey was determined as 19.6 out of 9-36 points. The overall level of agreement between the cut-off score and the classification of students who like/don't like learning mathematics using the criterion based on the expression given in the original scale description was found to be 83%. The results concluded that the validity of the standard-setting studies conducted with the artificial neural network method was high. As a result, researchers are recommended to use the Artificial Neural Networks method to determine the cut-off score to be used in the interpretation of the total scores obtained from the achievement test or the total scale scores obtained from the scales.","2023","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","53-62","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1408250","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1408250","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Education; Mathematics Achievement; Mathematics Tests; Grade 8; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Multiple Choice Tests; Cutting Scores; Standard Setting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As data analysis methods, multilayer perceptron and radial basis functions techniques of artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression were used. In the two-step analysis, first, the least erroneous model was selected as the analysis method. Then, variable importance analysis was performed with this method. The results with the lowest relative errors were obtained by the multilayer perceptron when compared to radial basis functions. The results of neural network analysis had similar or lower error rates when compared to multiple linear regression. In both PISA cycles, significant predictors were mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics interest, student-teacher relations in school, attitudes towards the school, mathematics self-concept, mathematics instrumental motivation, and teacher support in mathematics classes, respectively.

However, the associations between learning and learners' meta-affective capability are still unclear. The goal of this paper is to analyse meta-affective capability and its influence on learning outcomes as well as the dynamics of affect over time. Two criteria, awareness and self-regulation, were employed to define meta-affective capability. An exploratory study (n = 54) was conducted in which students at the secondary level were asked to interact with an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics and to self-report their affect during their interactions with the system. Pre-post learning outcomes were also measured. A post-hoc comparison of learning gains was made between more meta-affectively capable and less meta-affectively capable students. The results provide some empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that having meta-affective capability is positively associated with learning. Students not demonstrating meta-affective capability seemed to transition frequently from boredom to frustration (p = 0.0284) and from concentration to neutral (p = 0.0017). However, only a small percentage of the sample were classified as having meta-affective capability, indicating that it is important to scaffold students who are not meta-affectively capable.","2022-03","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","174-195","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1328317","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1328317","Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Education; Mathematics Achievement; Secondary School Students; Psychological Patterns; Metacognition; Achievement Gains; Affective Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to explore how ""sandbox"" or open-inquiry data science with social media supports learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers vignettes from an illustrative youth study case that highlights the pedagogical prospects and obstacles tied to designing for open-ended inquiry with computational data science to access or ""scrape"" Twitter/X. The youth case showcases how social media can be taken up productively and in ways that facilitate epistemological agency, an approach where individuals actively shape understanding and knowledge-creation processes, highlighting the potentially transformative impact this approach might have in empowering learners to engage productively. Findings: The authors identify three key affordances for learning that emerged from the illustrative case: (1) flexible opportunities for content-specific domain mastery, (2) situated inquiry that embodies next-generation science practices and (3) embedded computational skill development. The authors discuss these findings in relation to contemporary education needs to broaden participation in data science and computing. Originality/value: To address challenges in current data science education associated with supporting sustained and productive engagement in computing-based data science, the authors leverage a ""sandbox"" approach -- an original pedagogical framework to support open inquiry with precollege groups.

Development professionals help train teachers and get teachers to participate in studies. The platform and these teachers help researchers (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) simply by using content the teacher selects. The platform, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, allows teachers to write individual ASSISTments (composed of questions with answers and associated hints, solutions, web-based videos, etc.) or to use pre-built ASSISTments, bundle them together in a problem set, and assign these to students. The system gives immediate feedback to students while they are working and provides student-level data to teachers on any assignment. The word ""ASSISTments"" blends tutoring ""assistance"" with ""assessment"" reporting to teachers and students. While originally focused on mathematics, the platform now has content from many other subjects (e.g., science, English, Statistics, etc.). Due to the large library of mathematics content, however, it is mostly used by math teachers. Over 50,000 students used ASSISTments last school year (2013-4) and this number has been doubling each year for the last 8 years. The platform allows any user, mostly researchers, to create randomized controlled trials in the content, which has helped us use the tool in over 18 published and an equal number of unpublished studies. The data collected by the system has also been used in a few dozen peer-reviewed data mining publications. This paper will not seek to review these publications, but instead we will share why ASSISTments has been successful and what lessons were learned along the way. The first lesson learned was to build a platform for learning sciences, not a product that focused on a math topic. That is, ASSISTments is a tool, not a curriculum. A second lesson learned is expressed by the mantra ""Put the teacher in charge, not the computer."" This second lesson is about building a flexible system that allows teachers to use the tool in concert with the classroom routine. Once teachers are using the tool they are more likely to want to participate in research studies. These lessons were born from the design decisions about what the platform supports and does not support. In conclusion, goals for the future will be presented.","2014-12","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","470-497","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1042147","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1042147","Artificial Intelligence; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Mathematics Teachers; Educational Research; Secondary School Teachers; Secondary School Mathematics; Computer Software; Middle School Teachers; Formative Evaluation; Educational Cooperation; Educational Researchers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Constructing such models is a fundamental skill, but many students still lack the skill, even after taking several algebra courses in high school and college. For such students, we developed instruction that taught students to decompose the to-be-modelled situation into schema applications, where a schema represents a simple relationship such as distance-rate-time or part-whole. However, when a model consists of multiple schema applications, it needs some connection among them, usually represented by letting the same variable appear in the slots of two or more schemas. Students in our studies seemed to have more trouble identifying connections among schema applications than identifying the schema applications themselves. We developed several tutoring systems and evaluated them in university classes. One of them, a step-based tutoring system called OMRaaT (One Mathematical Relationship at a Time), was both reliably superior (p = 0.02, d = 0.67) to baseline and markedly superior (p < 0.001, d = 0.84) to an answer-based tutoring system using only commercially available software (MATLAB Grader).","2024","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","224-246","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1426338","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1426338","Mathematics Instruction; Algebra; Computer Software; College Students; Evaluation; Mathematical Models; Low Achievement; Tutorial Programs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EDM is the annual flagship conference of the International Educational Data Mining Society. The theme of this year's conference is ""Educational data mining for amplifying human potential."" Not all students or seekers of knowledge receive the education necessary to help them realize their full potential, be it due to a lack of resources or lack of access to high quality teaching. The dearth in high-quality educational content, teaching aids, and methodologies, and non-availability of objective feedback on how they could become better teachers, deprive our teachers from achieving their full potential. The administrators and policy makers lack tools for making optimal decisions such as optimal class sizes, class composition, and course sequencing. All these handicap the nations, particularly the economically emergent ones, who recognize the centrality of education for their growth. EDM-2023 has striven to focus on concepts, principles, and techniques mined from educational data for amplifying the potential of all the stakeholders in the education system. The spotlights of EDM-2023 include: (1) Five keynote talks by outstanding researchers of eminence; (2) A plenary Test of Time award talk and a Banquet talk; (3) Five tutorials (foundational as well as advanced); (4) Four thought provoking panels on contemporary themes; (5) Peer reviewed technical paper and poster presentations; (6) Doctoral students consortium; and (7) An enchanting cultural programme.

These data allow the educational stakeholders to discover new, interesting and valuable knowledge about students. In this paper, we present a new user-friendly decision support tool for predicting students' performance concerning the final examinations of a school year. Our proposed tool is based on a hybrid predicting system incorporating a number of possible machine learning methods and achieves better performance than any examined single learning algorithm. Furthermore, significant advantages of the presented tool are that it has a simple interface and it can be deployed in any platform under any operating system. Our objective is that this work may be used to support student admission procedures and strengthen the service system in educational institutions.","2016","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","43-57","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1130918","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1130918","Foreign Countries; Prediction; Student Evaluation; Secondary School Mathematics; Academic Achievement; Predictive Measurement; Data Analysis; Computer System Design; Courseware; Database Design; Database Management Systems; Decision Support Systems; Exit Examinations; Predictive Validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A student is said to have committed a careless error when the student's answer is wrong despite knowing the skill required to provide the correct answer. We operationalize the probability that an error is careless through the use of an automated detector, developed using educational data mining, which infers the probability that an error involves carelessness rather than not knowing the relevant skill. This detector is then applied to log data produced by high-school students in the Philippines using a Cognitive Tutor for scatterplots. We study the relationship between carelessness and affect, triangulating between the detector of carelessness and field observations of affect. Surprisingly, we find that carelessness is common among students who frequently experience engaged concentration. This finding implies that a highly engaged student may paradoxically become overconfident or impulsive, leading to more careless errors. In contrast, students displaying confusion or boredom make fewer careless errors. Further analysis over time suggests that confused and bored students have lower learning overall. Thus, their mistakes appear to stem from a genuine lack of knowledge rather than carelessness.","2014-06","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","189-210","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1036906","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1036906","Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; High School Students; Probability; Learner Engagement; Psychological Patterns; Self Esteem; Conceptual Tempo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YA7LG6PK","journalArticle","2013","Sklavakis, Dimitrios; Refanidis, Ioannis","MATHESIS: An Intelligent Web-Based Algebra Tutoring School","International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","","1560-4292","","","This article describes an intelligent, integrated, web-based school for tutoring expansion and factoring of algebraic expressions. It provides full support for the management of the usual teaching tasks in a traditional school: Student and teacher registration, creation and management of classes and test papers, individualized assignment of exercises, intelligent step by step guidance in solving exercises, student interaction recording, skill mastery statistics and student assessment. The intelligence of the system lies in its Algebra Tutor, a model-tracing tutor developed within the MATHESIS project, that teaches a breadth of 16 top-level math skills (algebraic operations): monomial multiplication, division and power, monomial-polynomial and polynomial-polynomial multiplication, parentheses elimination, collect like terms, identities (square of sum and difference, product of sum by difference, cube of sum and difference), factoring (common factor, term grouping, identities, quadratic form). These skills are further decomposed in simpler ones giving a deep domain expertise model of 104 primitive skills. The tutor has two novel features: a) it exhibits ""intelligent task recognition"" by identifying all skills present in any expression through intelligent parsing, and b) for each identified skill, the tutor traces all the sub-skills, a feature we call ""deep model tracing."" Furthermore, based on these features, the tutor achieves ""broad knowledge monitoring"" by recording student performance for all skills present in any expression. Forty teachers who evaluated the system in a 3-hours workshop appreciated the fine-grained step-by-step guidance of the student, the equally fine grained student model created by the tutor and its ability to tutor any exercise that contains the aforementioned math skills. The system was also used in a real junior high school classroom with 20 students for three months. Evaluation of the students' performance in the domain of factoring gave positive learning results.","2013","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","191-218","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1190019","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1190019","Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Education; Mathematics Teachers; Algebra; Skill Development; Mathematics Skills; Student Attitudes; Instructional Effectiveness; Difficulty Level; Models; Outcomes of Education; Junior High School Students; Program Evaluation; Usability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proof of concept is based on the example of teaching the 8th grade Algebra subject. The main contribution in this work is the implementation of innovative approaches in analysis and processing of data by expert system as well as the development of the step-by-step algorithm to build a table of dependencies between subjects in a course, known as Concept-Effect Relationship (CER) model, which is introduced in this research work. The CER model is the core component of the ES, based on which the system builds the individual educational strategy for a pupil. The problem of building a table of dependencies between subjects in a course has been a significant obstacle when using this approach in real life due to its time complexity and a demand for significant efforts from multiple experts. Our novel approach introduces a general algorithm for building a dependency table with no linking to a specific subject, thus making CER model implementation easier in real-life educational practice.","2013","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","42-47","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1053987","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1053987","Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics Instruction; Educational Technology; Algebra; Teaching Methods; Secondary School Mathematics; Academic Achievement; Models; Grade 8; Simulated Environment; Educational Benefits; Expertise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study uses multilayer perceptron model to form the artificial neural network model, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) algorithm to apply the decision trees method and linear discriminant analysis. The performance of each method has been investigated in different sample sizes when classifying into different numbered subgroups. The study has revealed that the artificial neural network has the best performance in large, medium and small sample sizes when classifying into six, three and two subgroups. In the very small sample size, which has homogeneous variance-covariance matrices, the discriminant analysis performs the best, while in the very small sample size, which does not have homogeneous variance-covariance matrices, it is the discriminant analysis which performs the best when classifying into six subgroups and the artificial neural network performs the best when classifying into two and three subgroups. Considering the performances of the methods with respect to sample size, it can be concluded that as the sample size gets smaller, the performance of the decision trees method gets worse, whereas the performance of the discriminant analysis method improves. No correlation of this kind has been found with regard to the artificial network method.","2020","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","773-799","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1280057","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1280057","Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Mathematics Achievement; Comparative Analysis; Academic Achievement; Classification; Models; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Science Achievement; Correlation; Decision Making; Networks; Discriminant Analysis; Sample Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NJ8N58Z3","thesis","2015","Alvin, Christopher Thomas","Synthesis with Hypergraphs","","","","","","Many problems related to synthesis with intelligent tutoring may be phrased as program synthesis problems using AI-style search and formal reasoning techniques. The _x000C_first two results in this dissertation focus on problem synthesis as an aspect of intelligent tutoring systems applied to STEM-based education frameworks, specifically high school geometry. Given a geometric _x000C_figure as input, our technique constructs a hypergraph representing logical deduction of facts, and then traverses the hypergraph to synthesize problems and their corresponding solutions.Using similar techniques, our third result is focused on exhaustive synthesis of molecules. This synthesis process involves bonding sets of basic, molecular `fragments' according to chemical constraints to create molecules of increasing size. For each input set of fragments, synthesis results in a significant set of molecules. Due to big data constraints we give special consideration in how to construct a corresponding molecular hypergraph based on a target, template molecule. Synthesis of the target molecule in a laboratory environment then corresponds to any path in the molecular hypergraph from the set of fragments to the target molecule.

Coding, in which the transcribed conversation is allocated to a set of features, is commonly employed to deal with the textual data arising from this dialogue. This is generally done manually and cannot provide timely feedback to the participants. To address this issue, we explored the possibility of automatically classifying the semantic content of classroom dialogue. Seven categories (prior-known knowledge, analysis, coordination, speculation, uptake, agreement and querying) were distinguished automatically using an artificial neural network-based model. The model achieved acceptable performance and was comparable to human coding. Information about quality of dialogue can be identified in a timely manner. With this knowledge, classroom dialogue can be managed more skilfully, and a more productive form of dialogue is likely to be achieved by teachers and students.","2021-06","2025-05-02 01:52:41","2025-05-02 01:52:41","","496-521","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1294560","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1294560","Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Teaching Methods; Feedback (Response); Computer Software; Classification; Learning Processes; Secondary School Students; Computational Linguistics; Elementary School Students; Science Instruction; Physics; Literacy Education; Networks; Classroom Communication; Semantics; Coding; Dialogs (Language)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This explanation of the processes of mathematical calculation owes much to the new approach to the study of knowledge, which has been developed from Jean Piaget's observation of child behavior and the broad range of new research into artificial intelligence. It is essentially concerned with providing a deeper  understanding of the thought processes that are involved in mathematical thinking; what goes on inside children's heads as they learn mathematics and do mathematical problem-solving. Among the areas considered are: the cognitive science approach to mathematics education; deficiency in typical school curricula; the nature of representations; the ""paradigm"" teaching strategy; recognition problems; retrieval, construction, and mapping; and basic concepts used to facilitate the discussion of human information processing as it related to solving mathematical problems.

Beginning with a definition of man machine systems and comments on the poor quality of much of the computer-based learning material currently available, the discussion focuses on how to make optimal use of the interaction between computers and students. The discussion includes definitions and concepts of this interaction, as well as examples of the use of artificial intelligence for computer-assisted instruction in problem-solving and mathematics. Also identified are four types of interactions between humans and machines and criteria and recommendations considered  important for effective interaction between students and computers. Specific uses of the computer in various disciplines, teacher attitudes towards computers, and the use of videotex are also discussed. A synthesis of these issues is provided, followed by three recommendations for making effective use of computer interactions in education in the future and an outline of some of the issues that should be considered when designing the user interface for students.

As the change in name signifies, a strong effort has been made to open the conference to a broader audience, including educational and cognitive psychologists interested in the problems of teaching and learning, and software designers interested in building systems to facilitate teaching and learning. The issues involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and education are of interest to a broad spectrum of researchers in education, psychology, and software systems. As in previous years, there are papers on tools and authoring systems, teaching architectures, student modelling, interfaces,  simulation, and empirical evaluation. Science education, especially biology, mathematics, and physics, receives attention, as do language and writing skills. Problems of corporate and industrial training are also addressed. Cooperative and collaborative learning involving groups of students is an important theme of many papers. Questioning and story-telling are taken as central to teaching and learning, as are the promotion of development and use of cognitive strategies. A number of papers address the question of how computer systems can aid teachers in such tasks as lesson planning. Finally, interactive video and hypermedia systems continue to grow in importance. Each of the 61 papers includes its own abstract and references; only the abstract is provided for six of the invited keynote  papers.

The addition of the ""+"" in the acronym incorporates the applications of communication and digital media technologies into the traditional four areas of study. All of the research underpinning the report makes use of the NMC's Delphi-based process for bringing groups of experts to a consensus viewpoint, in this case around the impact of emerging technologies on STEM+ education over the next five years. The same process underlies the NMC Horizon Report series, the most visible product of an ongoing research effort begun in 2002 to systematically identify and describe emerging technologies likely to have a large impact on education around the globe. The ""Technology Outlook for STEM+ Education 2013-2018"" was produced to explore emerging technologies and forecast their potential impact expressly in a STEM+ context. In the effort that ran from August through September 2013, the carefully selected group of 39 experts who contributed to this report considered hundreds of relevant articles, news, blog posts, research, and project examples as part of the preparation that ultimately pinpointed the most notable emerging technology topics, trends, and challenges for STEM+ education over the next five years. The report presents 12 ""technologies to watch,"" profiled, each on a single page that describes and defines a technology ranked as very important for STEM+ education over the next year, two to three years, and four to five years. Each page opens with a carefully crafted definition of the highlighted technology, outlines its educational relevance, points to several real life examples of its current use, and ends with a short list of additional readings for those who wish to learn more. The key sections of this report, in general, constitute a reference and straightforward technology-planning guide for educators, researchers, administrators, policymakers, and technologists. It is our hope that this research will help to inform the choices that institutions are making about technology to improve, support, or extend teaching, learning, and research across STEM+ education.

"XZMASBEY","report","2021","Quy, Tai Le; Roy, Arjun; Friege, Gunnar; Ntoutsi, Eirini","Fair-Capacitated Clustering","","","","","","Traditionally, clustering algorithms focus on partitioning the data into groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not sufficient in applications where a ""fair-representation"" of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a ""balanced cardinality"" among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the ""fair-capacitated clustering problem"" that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: (1) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint; and (2) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. Our experiments on three educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good clustering quality.

ACLS often involves a system that can automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant support and was more effective at improving student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of the support.","2014-01","2025-05-02 01:52:42","2025-05-02 01:52:42","","33-61","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1036903","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1036903","Cooperative Learning; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Program Effectiveness; Algebra; High School Students; Secondary School Mathematics; Tutoring; Helping Relationship; Peer Teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is noted that, although the students who attended the program were enthusiastic, the number of applicants was lower than had been expected. It is suggested that the low attendance was due in part to lack of encouragement by teachers. It is also suggested that the program ought to be longer in duration in order to provide more opportunities for hands-on experience. Finally, concern is expressed that the only female students who were interested in the program seemed to be students already considering study in science, technology, or mathematics,  despite the fact that the Sussex program is interdisciplinary in nature and might be of interest to students still undecided about their career paths.

The approach we outline has two major elements. First, students are asked to compute an ""average square."" Second, students work with an agent-based simulation that helps them to understand how aspects of the central limit theorem might be integrated into a much larger conversation about the appropriateness, or validity, of current psychometric practices. We are particularly interested in how such practices and interpretive frameworks inform the construction of high-stakes tests. In nearly all current high-stakes test development, tests are thought of as being built-up from individual items, each of which has known statistical properties. The activity sequence outlined in this paper helps future educators to understand the implications of this practice, and the sometimes problematic assumptions it entails. This instructional sequence has been used extensively as part of a core course in a university-based certification program in the United States (UTeach) recognized for its innovative approaches to developing a new generation of secondary STEM educators.","2011-10","2025-05-02 01:52:42","2025-05-02 01:52:42","","199-220","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ954107","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ954107","Artificial Intelligence; Computer Assisted Instruction; Secondary School Teachers; STEM Education; Computer Simulation; High Stakes Tests; Psychometrics; Teacher Education Programs; Test Construction; Measurement; Learning Theories; Item Response Theory; Core Curriculum; Education Courses; Educational Testing; Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Y258HMUI","journalArticle","2022","Le, Huixiao; Jia, Jiyou","Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Tutoring System in the View of Learner Autonomy","Interactive Technology and Smart Education","","1758-8510","","","Purpose: In intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), learners were often granted limited authority and are forced to obey the decision of the system which might not satisfy their needs. Failure to grant learners sufficient autonomy could yield unexpected effects that hinder learning, including undermining learners' motivation, priming learners' aversion to the algorithm. On the contrary, granting learners overwhelming autonomy could also be harmful as the absence of learning support would also have a negative impact on learning. As such, this study aims to design and implement an intelligent tutoring system that offers learners proper autonomy. Design/methodology/approach: The main learning activity in the system is doing exercises, and by finishing exercises learners could earn virtual coins. Based on item response theory, exercises are administered to learners with proper difficulty. Based on a recommended difficulty parameter predicted by the system, learners could manually modify the difficulty of the exercises, they could earn more credits by finishing more challenging exercises. Meanwhile, a pedagogical agent is embedded. Learners could customize the agent's personality jointly with the system to create the learning context they prefer. Findings: A intelligent tutoring system with proper learner autonomy (LA) is designed and implemented. Originality/value: Few previous researches have noticed the potentially important role that LA plays in ITS. Learning might be facilitated using such a design.","2022","2025-05-02 01:52:42","2025-05-02 01:52:42","","510-525","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1353227","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1353227","Artificial Intelligence; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Learning Activities; Design; Junior High School Students; Personal Autonomy; Web Based Instruction; Educational Psychology; Item Response Theory; Program Implementation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"Q3XEVIN7","report","1983","VanLehn, Kurt","Felicity Conditions for Human Skill Acquisition: Validating an AI-Based Theory. Cognitive and Instructional Sciences Series.","","","","","","A theory of how people learn certain procedural skills is presented. It is based on the idea that the teaching and learning that goes on in a classroom is like an ordinary conversation. The speaker (teacher) compresses a non-linear knowledge structure (the target procedure) into a linear sequence of utterances (lessons). The listener (student) constructs a knowledge structure (the learned procedure) from the utterance sequence (lesson sequence). Speakers unknowingly obey certain constraints, called felicity conditions or conversational postulates, which help listeners construct an appropriate knowledge structure. This research has shown that there are felicity conditions on lesson sequences that help students learn procedures. Three felicity conditions were discovered, forming  the central hypotheses in the learning theory, which was embedded in a model, a large computer program using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The model's performance was compared to data from several thousand students learning to subtract multidigit numbers, add fractions, and solve simple algebraic equations. A key criterion for the theory is that the set of procedures that the model ""learns"" should exactly match the set of procedures that students actually acquire. Both testing the predictions and arguing for the validity of the theory are included in the report.

The category of recommendation was determined by student scores on a quiz and a sensor-free engagement detection model. New video recommendations (i.e., category 1) were selected based on a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that takes input from an item response theory model. The recommendation system was evaluated in a large field experiment, both before and after school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show evidence of effectiveness of the video recommendation algorithm during the period of normal school operations, but the effect disappears after school closures.

In this study, we propose artificial neural networks to classify these types of graphical responses from a TIMSS 2019 item. We are comparing classification accuracy of convolutional and feed-forward approaches. Our results show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform feed-forward neural networks in both loss and accuracy. The CNN models classified up to 97.53% of the image responses into the appropriate scoring category, which is comparable to, if not more accurate, than typical human raters. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that the most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had been incorrectly scored by the human raters. As an additional innovation, we outline a method to select human-rated responses for the training sample based on an application of the expected response function derived from item response theory. This paper argues that CNN-based automated scoring of image responses is a highly accurate procedure that could potentially replace the workload and cost of second human raters for international large-scale assessments (ILSAs), while improving the validity and comparability of scoring complex constructed-response items.","2023-06","2025-05-02 01:52:42","2025-05-02 01:52:42","","556-585","","3","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1375633","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1375633","Artificial Intelligence; Elementary Secondary Education; Foreign Countries; Accuracy; Mathematics Achievement; Mathematics Tests; Test Items; Comparative Analysis; Computer Software; Classification; Models; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Science Achievement; Science Tests; Scoring; Test Validity; Item Analysis; Responses; Networks; Graphs; Item Response Theory; Evaluators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possible vehicle of technological change in mathematics classrooms is the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), an artificially intelligent computer-based tutor. This paper reports on 3 construct validity studies that have been conducted with 97 high school students in order to demonstrate the correspondence, or lack thereof, between the theoretical constructs of the Diagram Configuration (DC) Model of geometric proof-writing expertise (Koedinger & Anderson, 1990) and the hints and errors being recorded by an instantiation of the DC Model called ANGLE, an intelligent geometric proof tutor. Results of the studies  supported the appropriateness of construct validity techniques for analyzing ITS data. The results partially confirm a hypothesized factor structure for the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, including suggestions for modifications of the ANGLE program. (Contains nine references and six tables.)

The aim of this research was to determine factors affecting Turkish students' science achievements in order to identify the improvement areas using PISA 2015 dataset. To achieve this aim, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) approaches were used and these approaches were compared in terms of model accuracy statistics. Since Singapore was the top performer country in terms of science achievement in PISA 2015 survey, the analysis results of Turkey and Singapore were compared to each other to understand the differences. The results showed that MARS outperforms the CART in terms of measuring the prediction of students' science achievement. Furthermore, the most important factors affecting science achievements were environmental optimism, home possessions and science learning time (minutes per week) for Turkey, while the index of economic, social and cultural status, environmental awareness and enjoyment of science for Singapore.","2018","2025-05-02 01:52:43","2025-05-02 01:52:43","","887-903","","5","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ERIC Number: EJ1346811","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1346811","Artificial Intelligence; Foreign Countries; Accuracy; Prediction; Classification; Mathematics; Achievement Tests; International Assessment; Secondary School Students; Science Achievement; Regression (Statistics); Comparative Education; Family Environment; Goodness of Fit; Multivariate Analysis; Performance Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project was subdivided into five basic subproblems. First, research was done to arrive at a simple, easily testable information processing model that could describe both the encoding and rotation components of spatial thought. Second, a computer software/hardware package was developed to measure reaction times of encoding and rotational tasks using equipment that would be affordable to the average high school science teacher. Third, the instrument was field tested with high school students. Fourth, 37 students from a field of 107 biology and earth science students were identified  as being of high or low spatial ability. Finally, these students were tested with the developed instrument to investigate more fully the roles of encoding and mental rotation during spatial activity. The purpose of this project was to develop a working model of spatial thought so that it might be of use in persuading teachers to use intervention strategies on a more regular basis in the classroom. A problem section, literature review, methodology, results, conclusion, implications, and recommendations are included. Appended is a listing of the computer program used in this study.

The theme of this year's conference is EDM in Open-Ended Domains. As EDM has matured it has increasingly been applied to open-ended and ill-defined tasks such as writing, design, and collaborative problem solving, and it has been used in new informal contexts where student actions are at best semi-structured. This iteration of the conference includes a range of work in these and other areas. This year's conference features three invited talks: Julita Vassileva, Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada; Steve Ritter, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist, Carnegie Learning Inc., Pittsburgh; and Michael Mozer, Professor Department of Computer Science and Institute of Cognitive Science University of Colorado. The number of accepted papers include 22 full papers and 42 short papers. An additional 47 papers were accepted to the poster track. The poster and demo track itself accepted 14 contributions out of 34 submissions. Together with the ""Journal of Educational Data Mining"" (""JEDM""), the EDM 2019 conference held a ""JEDM"" Track that provides researchers a venue to deliver more substantial mature work than is possible in a conference proceeding and to present their work to a live audience. The papers submitted to this track followed the ""JEDM"" peer review process. Two such papers are featured in the conference's program. Additionally this year, papers that were regularly published in the journal in 2018 were invited for presentation at the conference. Two authors accepted this invitation. The main conference invited contributions to an Industry Track in addition to the main track. The EDM 2019 Industry Track received eleven submissions of which six were accepted. The EDM conference continues its tradition of providing opportunities for young researchers to present their work and receive feedback from their peers and senior researchers. The doctoral consortium this year features eight such presentations. This year's conference includes also an invited talk by the authors of the 2018 winner of the EDM Test of Time Award. This year's talk is delivered by Mykola Pechenizkiy. In addition to the main program, there are three workshops: (1) Learning Analytics: Building bridges between the Education and the Computing communities; (2) Reinforcement Learning for Educational Data Mining; and (3) Workshop on EDM & Games: Leveling Up Engaged Learning with Data-Rich Analytics. Three tutorials were presented as well: (1) Sharing and Reusing Data and Analytic Methods with LearnSphere; (2) Causal Discovery with Tetrad in LearnSphere's Tigris and Designing and Developing Open; and (3) Pedagogically-Based Predictive Models using the Moodle Analytics API.","2019","2025-05-02 01:52:43","2025-05-02 01:52:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781733673600 ERIC Number: ED599096","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED599096","Artificial Intelligence; Cooperative Learning; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics Instruction; Foreign Countries; Educational Research; Program Effectiveness; STEM Education; Mathematics Achievement; Prediction; Student Evaluation; High School Students; Teaching Methods; Thinking Skills; Concept Formation; Geometry; Man Machine Systems; English (Second Language); Handheld Devices; Inquiry; Language Teachers; Learning Activities; Skill Development; Online Courses; Student Motivation; Automation; Feedback (Response); Natural Language Processing; Prior Learning; Mathematics Skills; Grade Point Average; Predictor Variables; Computer Software; Ethics; Academic Achievement; Student Attitudes; Classification; Integrated Learning Systems; Difficulty Level; Justice; Models; Grade 8; Computation; Data Collection; Grades (Scholastic); Course Selection (Students); Institutional Characteristics; Gender Differences; College Students; Problem Solving; Dropouts; Minority Group Students; Data Analysis; Experiential Learning; Knowledge Level; Visualization; Second Language Learning; Academic Language; Student Characteristics; Video Games; Creativity; Educational Games; Equipment; Essays; Misconceptions; Peer Evaluation; Science Instruction; Student Satisfaction; Tests; Game Based Learning; Grading; Scoring; Undergraduate Students; Scores; Metacognition; Grouping (Instructional Purposes); Student Behavior; Interaction; Web Based Instruction; Homework; Social Influences; Telecommunications; Video Technology; Cooperation; Affective Behavior; Active Learning; Electronic Mail; Independent Study; Second Language Instruction; Cheating; Chinese; Error Patterns; Information Retrieval; Markov Processes; Programming; Reaction Time; Reinforcement; Semantics; Error Correction; Large Group Instruction; Success; Academic Failure; Individual Differences; At Risk Students; Emotional Response; Employment; Evidence Based Practice; Eye Movements; Graphs; Item Response Theory; Writing Processes; Writing Skills; Young Children; Mandarin Chinese; Search Strategies; Educational Administration; Grammar; Learning; Educational Needs; Instructional Materials; Content Analysis; Measurement Techniques; Career Choice; Elective Courses; Enrollment Trends; Friendship; Graduates; Help Seeking; Interpersonal Communication; Liberal Arts; Modeling (Psychology); Moral Values; Motion; Parent Role; Performance Based Assessment; Physiology; Resource Units; Social Values; Student Records; Test Selection; Time to Degree; Tone Languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, students' ubiquitous algebra errors have been taken as indicating the need to embed algebra in rich contextual settings (Kaput, 1995; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] Algebra Working Group, 1998). This study explored a nonrepresentational account of symbolic algebra skills as feature correlation within the visual field. We present evidence that algebra students respond spontaneously to the visual patterns of the notational display apart from engagement with the declarative content of the rules. Thus, persistent algebra errors may reflect disengagement from declarative content rather than an inability to deal with it. We sketch a Lexical Support System designed to sustain students' engagement with the declarative content of algebraic rules and processes, thus complementing the exciting curricular possibilities being developed for referentially rich algebra.

"HNHAXHNJ","report","1989","Wilson, Louise","Application of Technology to Cognitive Development.","","","","","","This report presents a summary of research being conducted at the University of Minnesota in which new technologies are being applied to development of cognition in hearing impaired learners. The study involved an application of concept analysis, information-processing theories, and group-based interactive technology in the teaching of mathematical word-problem-solving. Teaching strategies were implemented by means of a group interaction technology system called ""Discourse."" Discourse allows the teacher to enter questions and answers into the system and to display them on a large video screen.

The computer-based Leeds Modelling System (LMS) was implemented and a database of examples, correct and incorrect, or mal-rules had been established which was sufficient to diagnose the majority of difficulties encountered by 15-year-old students. When the same database was used with 24 14-year-old students, the outcome was very different. A high percentage of the student errors were not diagnosed by LMS. These protocols were analyzed in some detail, followed by individual interviews to determine the nature of the students' difficulties. Results obtained from the protocols and interviews indicate that there are two very  different types of mal-rules at large with algebra students, namely, manipulative (defining a manipulative mal-rule as a variant on a correct rule which has one substage either omitted or replaced by an inappropriate/incorrect operation) and parsing (incorrect representation of a task). Although bug-migration could be explained by repair theory, it appears that this second category of algebra errors (parsing) can best be explained by a mechanism called mis-generalization.

"B5MQNSR8","report","1984","Sleeman, D.","Basic Algebra Revisited: A Study with 14 Year Olds. Revision.","","","","","","A group of 24 14-year-old students were presented with sets of algebra tasks using the Leeds Modelling System (LMS), a computer-based modeling system. Four months later, these same students were given a paper-and-pencil test which covered comparable tasks set by LMS. In addition, certain students were given detailed diagnostic interviews. A comparison between the results obtained is presented. Results obtained on the paper-and-pencil test and the interviews were consistent, showing that students had some profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation. Furthermore, from the interviews it was possible to determine classes of strategies some students were using, including (1) searching for solutions (substituting) and (2) applying a ""global"" rule, such as collecting all numbers on  one side, whether or not they were coefficients. The overall picture evolving from this and other studies seems to be: (1) that the difficulties of learning algebra have been greatly under-estimated; (2) that students have a great difficulty in inferring their own rules, or sometimes higher-level schema, and then using them consistently and often in appropriate situations; and (3) that few students have evolved mechanisms by which they can verify whether a proposed algorithm is feasible.

"9RJ5WITC","report","1984","Sleeman, D.","An Attempt to Understand Students' Understanding of Basic Algebra.","","","","","","This paper reports the results obtained with a group of 24 14-year-old students when presented with a set of algebra tasks by the Leeds Modelling System (LMS). These same students were given a comparable paper-and-pencil test and detailed interviews some 4 months later. The latter studies uncovered several kinds of student misunderstanding that LMS had not detected. Some students had profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation; others used strategies such as substituting numbers for variables until the equation balanced. Additionally, it appears that the student errors fall into several distinct classes: namely, manipulative, parsing, clerical and ""random"". LMS and its rule database have been enhanced as the result of this experiment, and so LMS is now able to diagnose the  majority of the errors encountered in this experiment. Finally, the paper gives a process-orientated explanation for student errors, and re-examines related work in cognitive modelling in the light of the types of student errors reported in this experiment. Misgeneralization is a mechanism suggested to explain some of the mal-rules noted in this study.

Both those attempting to build, and those questioning the possibility of building intelligent artificial tutoring systems, struggle with the notions of mathematical understanding. The purpose of this essay is to show a transcendently recursive theory of mathematical understanding which is based on the consideration of understanding as a nonlinear process of growth. This theory of growth has a built-in dynamic of folding back to move out, but also shows understanding as an organizing process to entail action, perception of action, conception of percepts, conception of concepts, conception of forms (or classes) and logical explanation in an embedded manner. The theory and its elements, and the properties and  applications of the theory are discussed.

"9YAGAGT6","journalArticle","1990","Reusser, Kurt; Others, And","Tutoring Mathematical Word Problems Using Solution Trees: Text Comprehension, Situation Comprehension, and Mathematization in Solving Story Problems. Research Report No. 8.","","","","","","The main concern of this paper is on the psychological processes of how students understand and solve mathematical word problems, and on how this knowledge can be applied to computer-based tutoring. It is argued that only a better understanding of the psychological requirements for understanding and solving those problems will lead to instructional improvement. Introduced first are the major points of a psychological theory of strategic and goal-directed understanding and solving mathematical situation problems derived from work on discourse processing and on work on cognitive simulation related to word problems. Secondly, the psychological and didactic principles, and the techniques used for the development of a computerized tutor designed at helping students to solve complex,  verbally stated, mathematical problems are discussed. Developing partly intelligent tutoring systems may not only serve as a means to provide children with the kind of interactive problem solving and learning environments and instructional tools which have been described as didactic models of scaffolding and coaching, reflective learning, or of cognitive apprenticeship, respectively, but also serve as a means to the more fundamental educational goal of becoming an autonomous or self-directed learner. The computer tutoring program, called HERON, uses an iconic form of problem representation called solution trees or conceptual planning trees, a graphical network format of semantic concepts and mathematical operations, intended to capture the hierarchical structure of solution plans of  multi-step mathematical situation problems. A narrative and graphical description of the program is included.
