However, there is a gap between K-12 students and the LLM. The prompts given to LLM need to be well designed to be effectively utilized for K-12 education. To use LLMs more appropriately for K-12 STEM educational purposes, the author developed a prototype tool with prompt engineering to fully utilize the educational potential of LLMs and reduce usage for academic dishonesty. The tool would have a student register by giving the grade that they're in, and then ask as the topic the student would like to learn more about. Using prompt engineering techniques, the tool can prompt LLMs to produce educational content such as a descriptions, question and answer, AI-generated quizzes, and reviews, as well as asking the LLM to simplifying complex topics further to aid in understanding. The AI-enabled tool, effectively a virtual and personal mentor, could help propel STEM education further and make STEM more interesting to students as it could help explain complex topics in a way that students can understand easily. The tool and AI can help students understand a topic through interactive practice instead of just memorizing facts and putting them on a sheet of paper. The tool present in this paper will enhance the STEP education by AI. © 2024 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Academic dishonesty; Educational contents; Educational potential; Engineering techniques; Interactive practice; K-12 education; Language model; Learn+; Prototype tools; STEM education; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205599515"

Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","caregivers; hybrid tutoring; K-12; large language models; mathematics education; tutoring systems","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Curricula; Open source software; Teaching; Caregiver; Case-studies; Community IS; Hybrid tutoring; K-12; Language model; Large language model; Mathematics education; System intelligence; Tutoring system; Students","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000440085"

TIMSS 2019 and PISA 2022 results show that the Philippines ranked last in mathematics in international assessments. Computer educational games influence academic achievement motivation. In connection with the challenges faced by public grade 8 students to the difficulty of mathematics, the development of the web-based application aims to teach students more about math and further develop their skills through motivation by using gamification and reward systems. This study focuses on the design and development of a web application incorporating gamification functionality to enhance the usability, motivation, and engagement of the grade 8 students’ learning probability to promote student learning. The study was conducted at Benigno”Ninoy” S. Aquino High School. A quantitative research design was used in this study to examine the academic performance of grade 8 students. This quantitative approach was used to conduct a study to identify the differences between the experimental and control groups. The data was gathered through a quiz-type activity for the controlled and experimental groups. The study findings revealed that the experimental group, which was exposed to the gamified web application, had higher mean scores than the control group. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the two groups. With a T-statistics = 10.748957 and P-value = 1.908744e-11, this demonstrates a considerable difference in knowledge development between traditional learning methods and the use of a web application. The findings validated the research question, which asked whether there was a substantial difference between the two methods of teaching. These findings have important implications for high school education, demonstrating the potential of the Web application’s gamification design as a great tool for engaging and educating Grade 8 students about probability. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Accessibility; Achievement motivation; E-Learning; Gamification; Traditional Learning; Web Application","Adversarial machine learning; Computer games; Federated learning; Gamification; Students; Web Design; Academic performance; Accessibility; Achievement motivations; E - learning; Experimental groups; Gamification; Reward systems; Traditional learning; WEB application; Web applications; Contrastive Learning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218414774"

However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Computational thinking; Mathematical creativity; Mathematics; Unplugged activities","","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204959686"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States. Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups. Implications: The findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings. © 2024 The Author(s).

The purpose of the S-STEM program is to provide scholarships and programming to recruit, retain and graduate low-income scholars in STEM disciplines. S-STEM offers grants in three tracks: Track 1, Institutional Capacity Building; Track 2, Implementation by a Single Institution; and Track 3, Inter-Institutional Consortia. Currently, West Virginia University Institute of Technology (WVU Tech) has a Track 1 S-STEM project and is participating in an accelerator grant program administered by a Track 3 project at Virginia Tech. Recruitment for S-STEM programs can be a challenge. To combat this challenge, the present study is part of a larger initiative to investigate intra-institutional partnerships and share findings broadly to help ensure that no eligible S-STEM scholars are overlooked in future S-STEM program recruitment efforts. Institutional partners at WVU Tech included the S-STEM principal investigators, financial aid, the Student Success Center where first year advising occurs, enrollment management where admissions is housed and university relations where marketing and communications is housed. The current study focused on efforts to recruit S-STEM scholars over two recruitment cycles. To better understand current recruitment efforts, institutional partners and current S-STEM scholars responded to reflection prompts about their experience with recruitment. The sample included all institutional partners and 13 out of 14 scholars. The authors analyzed the written reflections using thematic content analysis with most findings relating to (1) factors in awareness and decision making, (2) reasons for applying, (3) hesitancies and potential barriers and (4) future opportunities and communication strategies. The study revealed that staff perspectives regarding what worked for students did not necessarily align with student perspectives. Students were informed and influenced both internally by institutional partners and externally by relatives and high school teachers. There was not one form of communication that was clearly most effective. Rather, each mode of communication (the website, emails, print materials and word of mouth) played an important role in reaching different groups of potential scholars. These and other findings from the study can provide guidance for future S-STEM and related programs to help ensure that partnerships are leveraged effectively, and recruitment efforts are successful. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Personnel training; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Teaching; 'current; Engineering program; Institutes of technologies; Institutional capacities; Low incomes; Math programs; National programme; National Science Foundations; Science technologies; West Virginia; Decision making","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202073727"

Researches indicates that students who participate in space education programs become more interested in science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM) fields. Many of these space education initiatives are informal. Space education gives students the opportunity to study multiple disciplines, enabling them to acquire critical skills. This abstract suggests a method for including space education in formal education systems to incorporate transdisciplinary STEAM subjects. It offers a summary of space education and recommends a number of original space education exercises that might be incorporated into formal education programs. The term STEAM is frequently used to refer to simply one of the subjects that it encompasses, most frequently science. Even while an increasing number of studies are promoting the integration of STEAM fields, few of them deal with several fields, and the ones that offer conflicting results and insufficient guidance for furthering STEAM research. Prior research indicates that applying knowledge and abilities from multiple disciplines to real-world challenges and projects might enhance the overall learning experience. This requirement is met by space education, which combines a multidisciplinary approach with real-world application. Therefore, it is proposed that space education be included in the formal framework within the context of disciplinary integration, transdisciplinary learning, and the application of theory. Earlier research describes a range of informal space education programs (SEPs) provided globally by space agencies. According to assessments of these non-formal learning initiatives, space education through these programs can pique kids’ interest and inspire them to enrol in classes and subsequently seek jobs in engineering, science, or technology. Though informal SEPs have proven beneficial, space education has not yet been widely incorporated into formal education curriculum. This abstract defines a SEP as the formal instruction, training, and incorporation of space-related topics within science and technology curricula. The following cognitive abilities are referred to as STEAM skills: critical thinking, scientific literacy, digital literacy, mathematical literacy, and creative thinking. The research findings presented in this paper will be utilized to develop a SEP teaching model that can be incorporated into science and technology curricula for middle schools. The purpose of the study is to investigate how SEP affects middle school students’ cognitive skill acquisition; analyse how SEP has affected middle school pupils’ understanding of science and technology; analyse the general perspectives of students regarding science and technology; create a SEP program that can be incorporated into high school science and technology curricula.

Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are topics of great importance and interest but are often reserved for higher-level education. Introductions of complex subjects in high school promotes student efficacy, enthusiasm, and skill-development for STEM careers. Establishing strong partnerships between universities and high schools is mutually beneficial for the professional development of students, teachers, and professors. In this paper, we detail immersive outreach efforts and their effectiveness in a high school setting. Methods: From Spring 2021 to Spring 2024, we conducted eight data-science and analysis-coding style workshops along with two data science units, with 302 students participating in the data science workshops and 82 students in the data science units. All students who participated in the data science lessons completed a comprehensive final project. Surveys measuring knowledge and appeal to data science and coding were conducted both retrospectively and prospectively, before and after each workshop and the data science units. A 1 year follow up survey was conducted for students in the 2023 data science lessons (n = 23). Results: Overall, average student interest significantly increased from 2.72 ± 1.08/5.0 (n = 205) to 3.15 ± 1.18/5.0 (n = 181, p = 0.001) during the data science workshops, while 70% of students expressed desire to continue with coding. Interest modestly increased in the data science lessons from 3.15 ± 0.65/4.0 to 3.17 ± 0.77/4.0 (n = 82, p = 0.8571), while knowledge significantly increased from 64.16% to 88.5% (% correct out of six questions) in the 2023 data science lessons and from 52.62% to 60.79% (% correct out of 29 questions) in the 2024 data science lessons. Discussion: Increasing STEM exposure through outreach programs and a modified curriculum can positively alter students’ career trajectory and prepare them for the evolving technologically advanced world and the careers within it.

Data-Driven Learning (DDL) is a didactic approach that treats language as data and sees students as researchers doing guided discovery activities. The exploration of corpora can effectively support reflection on the specialized languages of Mathematics. What data should be used? Students daily use the most recent Large Language Models (LLM) and Google, which can be used for linguistic investigations. However, it must be remembered that there is no total control over the data on which searches are carried out, the results, and the type of language they use. Control over the data is important, especially when teachers want to use these tools to design and deliver didactic activities. This paper presents a recent DDL research activity with 80 secondary school students on the specialized language of Mathematics. The students conducted linguistic investigations on a specially designed corpus and carried out corpus-based activities with automatic formative assessment within a Digital Learning Environment. The results show that the students appreciated the proposed activities. They develop linguistic and mathematical skills and become more aware of the importance of the language they use. Students developed digital skills in browsing, searching, and filtering data, as well as in evaluating data, information, and digital content. LLM, such as ChatGPT, could not be used for the same type of activity, but with appropriate design, they can be used as a starting point for investigation and linguistic reflection. In the future, given the notable diffusion of these AI tools, it is essential to train teachers and students on their strengths and weaknesses and how they influence teaching and learning. © The Author(s) 2025.","Data-Driven Learning; Language for Specific Purposes; Large Language Model; Mathematics Education","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Data assimilation; Information filtering; Linguistics; Teaching; Daily use; Data driven; Data-driven approach; Data-driven learning; Language for specific purpose; Language model; Large language model; Learning difficulties; Mathematics education; Teachers'; Students","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208623551"

By the early twentieth century this region was well-known as a center for innovation and entrepreneurship, becoming the top site in the country in patents per capita in 1903 when the university's namesakes Orville and Wilbur Wright flew. Wright State University was created in 1967 to meet the region's needs for research, innovation and education and is situated on land that formerly belonged to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), home of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and five directorates. Technology companies surround the university and base, creating a vibrant innovation hub. To this day, electrical engineering continues to play a large role in the workforce and in opportunity afforded the citizenry, university and prospective and current students of all ages. In a proactive move to provide students more flexibility, electrical engineering faculty members at Wright State University conducted an in-depth review of all course pre-requisites to streamline the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) program and make it more adaptable for students with diverse experiences to progress through their degrees. This includes high school students accessing university curricula through the state's dual enrollment opportunities; a technology workforce heavy in job opportunities, internships and co-ops for those with degrees and interest in electrical engineering at all levels; a large influx of active and retired military and civilians; and an accessible and affordable research university in the heart of it all. Among others, changes in pre-requisites occurred in both Continuous Linear Systems and Discrete Linear Systems, which had previously been offered respectively in sequence and had required higher-level mathematics. These gateway courses were both reorganized with the same pre-requisites effective Summer 2022 - Analog Circuit Theory with accompanying laboratory and Calculus II - without any particular ordering of linear systems courses; that is, students may take continuous first, discrete first, or both courses simultaneously. This flexibility recognizes that diverse student experiences may enhance student success dependent upon the first course passed. Of note, Analog Circuit Theory now includes electrical quantities and their relationships, transform-calculus impedance models, conservation models leveraging algebraic solutions, transform-calculus-derived algebraic models of dynamic systems, and mathematical solution techniques. Calculus II remains fairly standard and includes integration techniques, applications of the definite integral, numeral integration and improper integrals, parametric equations and polar coordinates, and infinite sequences and series. The author taught both linear systems courses in addition to follow-on control courses before and after these pre-requisite changes were implemented and was successful in transitioning learning achievement to the new pre-requisite scenario. Both courses are gateway, required courses for the BSEE, often are first courses in the major that challenge students theoretically, and either or both may become a barrier to success; as such, they have higher rates of students earning a D or an F or withdrawing from the class with a W (i.e., DFW rates). Many required courses and technical electives in the junior and senior years dictate proficiency in foundational linear systems topics. For these reasons and at the author's recommendation, the Wright State University College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) Undergraduate Policy and Curriculum Committee selected these two linear systems courses to include in a year-long, university-wide initiative to improve student success. Although originally designed for online/hybrid implementation, many of the innovative strategies on creating learning communities reported here port seamlessly to in-person classes and benefit students regardless of content or modality. Such ideas were implemented in the author's Summer 2023 online/hybrid course and Fall 2023 in-person/hybrid offering of Discrete Linear Systems with promising results. The section following provides additional motivation and novel strategies demonstrated to be particularly attuned with the current generation of students effected by COVID-19 and other disruptions in learning. With flexibility at the forefront, important factors to student success and skills gaps are addressed. Specific course enhancements and results then are highlighted and conclusions described. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Aerospace industry; Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Biological warfare; Biological weapons; Chemical warfare; Constraint handling; Curricula; Decision support systems; Directed-energy weapons; Empowerment of personnel; Energy balance; Fighter aircraft; Frequency agility; Gateways (computer networks); Ground operations; High-entropy alloys; Learning systems; Linear systems; Military aviation; MIMO systems; Nonlinear network synthesis; Stochastic systems; System theory; Teaching; Bachelor of science; Circuits theory; Computer scientists; Discrete linear systems; Learning community; Pre-requisites; Public research; Research universities; Student success; Twentieth century; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202066910"

The iAM Program has increased Scholar retention, academic performance, and engagement with student support services relative to peers. The program received NSF funding in 2022 to include a collaboration between Nassau Community College (NCC), a local two-year community college, and Hofstra University (HU) to create a seamless pathway for students from local high schools, through five NCC STEM majors (Biology, Computer Science, Engineering Science, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Math) to HU, culminating in a STEM BA/BS degree and entry into a STEM profession. It will accomplish these goals by augmenting the original program [3] with components to address challenges specific to NCC: a summer research experience, ALEKS for math placement support [4], joint NCC/HU advising, and an annual NCC/HU STEM faculty conference to strengthen curricular ties across institutions. The original iAM Program developed and utilized five components at the four-year institution: integrated support services, a STEM writing and metacognition seminar, dynamic hierarchical mentoring, financial support for Pell-eligible students, and a responsive program structure (Figure 1). Both NCC and HU are located in a community in which more than 93% of high school students are minoritized in the sciences and more than 65% are low income. Our objectives are to: (1) shorten the length of time to earn STEM AS and BA/BS degrees, (2) increase feelings of belonging and identity with NCC and HU, (3) increase identity and confidence as STEM students and professionals, (4) ensure consistent engagement with student support services (e.g., academic success, career counseling and placement), (5) catalyze interdisciplinary and inter-institutional pedagogical collaborations, (6) identify curricular and co-curricular factors contributing to student success and career entry, (7) institutionalize sustainable, high impact practices, and (8) adapt and develop processes for other institutions to follow. The expanded program will support 90 unique Scholars. The HU entryway recruits STEM majors who were academically strong in high school and who initially underperform at HU. The NCC/HU entryway recruits local, academically successful high school students. Our goal is to increase HU and NCC/HU Scholar retention, transfer, and graduation rates by 25% relative to peers. This work-in-progress paper focuses on NCC and the importance of recruitment, perseverance, and retention/transfer rate to HU. It details the iAM Program model and discusses the challenges and achievements of the first year of implementation of the community college cohort, summer research program, and the faculty collaborations between the institutions including the jointly hosted day-long faculty workshop. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Curricula; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economic geology; Emotional intelligence; Engineering research; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Teaching; Colleges and universities; Community college; First year; High school students; Mentoring programs; Student success; Student supports; Support services; Transfer rates; University partnership; Engineering education","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202013558"

The rare occurrence of such assessments makes it harder to identify students likely to fail such assessments, as well as making it slow for researchers and educators to be able to assess the effectiveness of particular educational tools. Prior work has primarily focused on using logs from students full usage (e.g. year-long) of an educational product to predict outcomes, or considered predictive accuracy using a few minutes to predict outcomes after a short (e.g. 1 hour) session. In contrast, we investigate machine learning predictors using students' logs during their first few hours of usage can provide useful predictive insight into those students' end-of-school year external assessment. We do this on three diverse datasets: from students in Uganda using a literacy game product, and from students in the US using two mathematics intelligent tutoring systems. We consider various measures of the accuracy of the resulting predictors, including its ability to identify students at different parts along the assessment performance distribution. Our findings suggest that short-term log usage data, from 2-5 hours, can be used to provide valuable signal about students' long term external performance. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Data mining across educational contexts; K-12 education; Long-term student outcomes prediction; Quantitative analysis; Short-horizon data","Students; Data mining across educational context; Educational context; Educational tools; K-12 education; Log data; Long-term student outcome prediction; Outcome prediction; Predictive accuracy; Short-horizon data; Student outcomes; Contrastive Learning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000456409"

However, there is still room for improvement in maximising the social returns they provide on investments. Many factors and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on providing public administration with advanced decision-making tools. First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of the Programa para la Mejora de Éxito Educativo (Programme for the Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla y Léon in Spain, in 2018–2019, the academic year previous to the pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO). Second, we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and explained how different factors and components affect student engagement and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; Public policy analysis; Tutoring program","Budget control; Decision making; Learning systems; Public administration; Students; Decision making tool; Learning evaluations; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Policy analysis; Public policy analyse; Research focus; Risk of failure; Student engagement; Tutoring program; computer simulation; machine learning; numerical model; policy analysis; technological change; technological development; Machine learning","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178346572"

Specifically, five ARLEs with different design features were developed and implemented with 136 seventh-grade students in two rounds. Data were gathered from pre- and post-mathematics self-efficacy tests, interviews, classroom observation records and reflective journals, to identify which design features promote or hinder students' learning and self-efficacy. Results revealed that adopting a well-designed ARLE is a viable way to promote students' learning and mathematics self-efficacy, and the success of ARLE lies in (1) coherent tasks with proper time for self-exploration, progressive levels, useful problem contexts and a certain degree of open-endedness, and (2) sufficient technological affordances with strengthened authenticity, clarity and integrated media presentation, as well as engaging interactions with decent flexibility, embodied actions and feedback. These results validated the applicability of the proposed checklist for ARLE designers and practitioners in their design and implementation of ARLEs, within the domain of mathematics, physics and beyond. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AR-based learning environments (ARLEs) have demonstrated substantial advantages in STEM education, but ARLEs can be a drawback if they are not adequately designed. ARLE may facilitate students' mathematics self-efficacy, and relevant design features are underexplored. Design-based research sustains interventions combining empirical research and theory-driven design of innovative learning environments, for example, ARLEs. What this paper adds Demonstrates the potential of ARLEs that can be used in classrooms to support STEM learning. Identifies a collection of effective and ineffective design features of ARLEs that promote or hinder students' STEM learning and mathematics self-efficacy. Tackles the challenges for the design of ARLEs for classrooms by taking AR technological affordances and the pedagogical perspective together. Implications for practice and/or policy Five ARLEs for STEM topics were developed and implemented in secondary schools.

Integrating Generative AI (GAI) into math education shows promise for bridging the gender gap in K12 math learning. This study proposes an innovative pedagogy and platform that enables students to create math stories powered by GAI, enhancing their conceptual understanding of key mathematical ideas. The platform was implemented in two K5 schools to evaluate its effectiveness and mechanism (N = 86). Pre- and post-intervention surveys and usage logs indicated significant improvements in students' learning outcomes regarding Math Question (MQ) skills and Math Story (MS) skills. Bayes SEM further modeled the mechanism: students' creating math stories powered by GAI significantly improves MS, which further improves MQ. We further found female students were significantly more engaged in creating stories on this platform and gained more improvement on MQ than male students. The results suggest that AI-powered math story creation can be an effective tool for deepening students' mathematical learning outcomes and has the potential to mitigate the gender gap. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Gender gap; Generative AI; Learning outcomes; Math story","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Conceptual understanding; Female students; Gender gap; Generative AI; Learning opportunity; Learning outcome; Math story; Performance; Post interventions; Student learning outcomes; Contrastive Learning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000247910"

Educational robots are specifically designed and used for teaching and learning purposes and attain the interest of learners in gaining knowledge about science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Educational robots are widely applied in different fields of primary and secondary education, but their usage in teaching higher education subjects is limited. Even when educational robots are used in tertiary education, the use is sporadic, targets specific courses or subjects, and employs robots with narrow applicability. In this work, we propose a holistic approach to the use of educational robots in tertiary education. We demonstrate how an open source educational robot can be used by colleges, and universities in teaching multiple courses of a computer science curriculum, fostering computational and creative thinking in practice. We rely on an open-source and open design educational robot, called FOSSBot, which contains various IoT technologies for measuring data, processing it, and interacting with the physical world. Grace to its open nature, FOSSBot can be used in preparing the content and supporting learning activities for different subjects such as electronics, computer networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, etc. To support our claim, we describe a computer science curriculum containing a wide range of computer science courses and explain how each course can be supported by providing indicative activities. The proposed one-year curriculum can be delivered at the postgraduate level, allowing computer science graduates to delve deep into Computer Science subjects. After examining related works that propose the use of robots in academic curricula we detect the gap that still exists for a curriculum that is linked to an educational robot and we present in detail each proposed course, the software libraries that can be employed for each course and the possible extensions to the open robot that will allow to further extend the curriculum with more topics or enhance it with activities. With our work, we show that by incorporating educational robots in higher education we can address this gap and provide a new ledger for boosting tertiary education. © 2024 by the authors.","computer science; computer science curriculum; educational robots; FOSSBot","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191292133"

The final analytic sample comprised of 66,451 Australian high school students across 304 schools in Years 7–10, who used the AdaptiveMath ITS platform in 2023. Structural Equation Modelling was employed to examine both the direct and indirect effects of school socioeducational advantage and rurality on student usage of the AdaptiveMath platform, and the resulting student learning outcomes. This study finds marginal, but statistically significant relationships between ITS usage and learning outcomes, and the socioeducational advantage and rurality of a student's school. Students who are from more affluent and urban schools use the ITS platform earlier in their school career, for more years, and have higher learning outcomes than their rural, less affluent peers. Further, ITS usage was found to mediate the relationship between socioeducational advantage and rurality, such that it amplified the positive effects of socioeducational advantage, and the negative effects of rurality, upon learning outcomes. The results suggest that introducing ITS platforms into Australian mathematics teaching will not reduce achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged schools. Rather, a Matthew Effect may be observed, whereby students attending privileged schools use ITS platforms more effectively, thereby contributing to an even greater disparities in learning outcome. © 2025 The Authors","Digital divide; Educational inequality; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Mathematics learning outcomes; Rurality; socioeconomic status; Socioeducational advantage","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Digital divide; Educational inequality; Intelligent tutoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning outcome; Mathematic learning outcome; Mathematics learning; Rurality; Socio-economic status; Socioeducational advantage; Tutoring system; Contrastive Learning","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002740299"

For the US, the quality and breadth of its STEM education will shape its future role on the global stage, driving innovation and addressing pressing challenges from Artificial Intelligence to climate change resilience, advancing healthcare, agricultural solutions, and others. However, the country lacks active participation from young minds in STEM fields. This problem is particularly true for students who are minorities, economically disadvantaged, or from rural areas due to the existence of multiple barriers. Although numerous summer camps have been employed to some degree of measurable success to facilitate a positive outlook toward STEM career choices for some time, limited studies investigate how such summer camps impact female students from Rural Independent School Districts (R-ISD), especially the ones that are few hours from the country's southern border. Further, summer camps offer students exceptional opportunities to engage in learning experiences, explore advanced technologies, establish meaningful connections with like-minded peers, and better understand future career choices. Therefore, given the benefits of intervention via summer camps and the lack of research in the identified geographical region, this research aimed to determine the impacts of summer camps developed on a previously published framework to determine if the intervention enhanced the participant's STEM and soft skills, knowledge, future career, and educational choices of female students from R-ISD. The participating students were subjected to a pre-test to determine the baseline at the beginning of the summer camp. A post-test was conducted at regular intervals to measure the summer camp's impacts on the knowledge, future career, and educational choices of participating female students from R-ISD. Both pre and post-tests were conducted online using Qualtrics, as it allowed for quicker data collection and value. The findings indicate a change in the female participant's outlook after the summer camps. Therefore, as the country solidifies its position as a global STEM powerhouse, tapping into the potential of all its citizens is paramount. Our study suggests that targeted interventions, such as summer camps, can play a significant role in this endeavor, particularly for underserved demographics. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","High School Students; Minority; STEM Career Perceptions; _Summer Camp","Artificial intelligence; Biographies; Economic and social effects; Employment; Engineering education; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Engineering and mathematics; Female students; High school students; Minority; Science education; Science technologies; Science, technology, engineering, and mathematic career perception; Summer camp; Technology education; _summer camp; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202065163"

While extensive research has focused on enhancing Algebra learning in K-12 education, the reusability, scalability, and effectiveness of the strategies employed (e.g., manual interventions and digital tutoring platforms) remain limited. Conversational AI (ConvAI), enabled by the advancement of large language models (LLMs), emerges as a potential tool for automatic, personalized, and effective student support. However, ethical concerns surrounding diversity, safety, sentiment, and stereotype associated with ConvAI are prominent, and empirical studies examining its application in education are scarce. The purpose of this study is to develop a ConvAI system that mitigates the potential ethical concerns and empirically evaluate the effect of such a system for math learning. Specifically, we first examined computational strategies to mitigate the ethical concerns of ConvAI in educational setting with educational big data (npretraining = 2,097,139) and found that researchers could effectively enhance ConvAI responsibility through the investigated algorithmic strategies. Then, a ConvAI system was constructed using these strategies, guided by learning sciences principles. Lastly, we examined students' eye-tracking patterns, acceptance, and learning processes when using this ConvAI system to learn Algebra through a random experiment (nparticipant = 151). Participants using the developed ConvAI demonstrated generally increased visual attention levels as compared to the control group. Moreover, participants expressed a positive acceptance towards the ConvAI technology. Finally, participants' interaction patterns with the ConvAI technology influenced their Algebra learning. These results provide insights for both educational researchers and practitioners to integrate ConvAI in learning environments. © 2024 The Authors","Conversational AI; FAccT AI in education; Large language models; Math learning; Technology design and development","Adversarial machine learning; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Federated learning; Reusability; Students; AI systems; Conversational AI; Design and Development; Ethical concerns; FAccT AI in education; Language model; Large language model; Math learning; Technology designs; Technology development; Contrastive Learning","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212179798"

With this challenge in mind, Empowerment in STEM Day was organized by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), hosting 47 high school students from 6 public high schools in the area. This one-day event was designed and executed through a collaboration between the Women's Support and Empowerment Council (WSEC) and the K-12 STEM Education and Outreach Program at LBNL. The main goal of this program was to provide high school girls, who have little access to STEM career role-models in their immediate surroundings with insights into how a career in STEM looks like. Invitations to participate in the program were sent out to six local high schools in the Bay area asking educators to identify female students that were interested in STEM. Each high school participant was provided with an opportunity to experience a national laboratory environment, learn more about summer workshops and paid summer research internship opportunities at LBNL for high school students, and engage directly with LBNL's employees through job shadow, career mapping and speed networking sessions. In this paper, we will present an overview of the event organization, challenges faced during planning and execution of the event, discuss the lessons learned from the first Empowerment in STEM Day and suggest strategies for incorporating such events at other national laboratories and academic institutions as part of a vital effort into recruiting and retaining more high school girls in STEM-based careers. Additionally, since this was the first in-person event hosted by LBNL's K-12 Program after the pandemic, we will also share the strategies implemented at the event so as to engage both remote and on-site employees as volunteers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","career development; high school girls; national laboratory K-12 outreach; STEM outreach","Artificial intelligence; Empowerment of personnel; Engineering education; Human engineering; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Career development; Engineering and mathematics; High school girl; High school students; Higher School; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National laboratory; National laboratory K-12 outreach; Science technologies; Science, technology, engineering, and mathematic outreach; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202035948"

Through empirical investigation, emotional reactions of online mathematics students are explored, with attention to gender-related differences in emoji usage. A survey administered to 100 students prompts them to select emojis conveying their sentiments towards mathematical problems. Statistical analyses reveal that emojis effectively capture students’ emotions, with an emphasis on gender-based variations in selection. These insights illuminate the dynamics of emotional expression and hold implications for fostering comprehensive learning environments that mitigate negative emotions such as mathematical anxiety.

The adaptive learning system is emerging as a promising approach to achieving personalized learning. The cognitive model plays a crucial role as the fundamental rationale behind the adaptive learning system. Currently, there is no uniform and highly operational method for constructing cognitive models. This study adopts Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) as the foundational approach for constructing a cognitive model of solid geometry. Based on literature and expert opinions, 17 cognitive attributes of high school solid geometry were identified. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey involving 40 experts was conducted to establish the contextual relationships among these attributes. Applying the ISM method resulted in a seven-level model. This model was then revised based on expert opinions to create the final cognitive model, revealing three primary paths within the domain of high school solid geometry. This paper contends that the use of the ISM method for constructing cognitive models is effective and objective.

Despite efforts made in this regard, learning outcomes have not improved sufficiently. Therefore, further investigation is needed on this issue, adopting new perspectives (conceptual and analytical) to facilitate the understanding and design of effective actions. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of executive functions (considering both cognitive and affective processes) and their interactions on learning outcomes in Language and Literature and Mathematics in Spanish students, through the use of artificial intelligence, based on the machine learning approach, and more specifically, the decision tree technique. A total of 173 students in compulsory secondary education (12–17 years old) from the same educational institution participated. The school’s educational counsellor provided information on student executive function levels by completing the BRIEF2 questionnaire for each participant. She also reported on the learning outcomes achieved by students in the subjects of interest for this research (Language and Literature and Mathematics). R software was used to model the regression trees. The results revealed groups of students characterised by different profiles, i.e., by different combinations of difficulties in various executive functions and varying levels of learning outcomes in each academic area. However, regardless of the academic area considered (Language and Literature or Mathematics), working memory was identified as the most relevant executive function in all of the students’ learning outcomes. Understanding the combination of executive functions that predict learning outcomes in each group of students is important since it enables teachers and other educational professionals, policymakers and researchers to provide individualised educational resources according to the diverse student profiles and needs. It constitutes an effective mechanism to improve students’ learning results and, ultimately, to enhance an equitable and more effective educational system. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","Springer Nature","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209536900"

The use of technology software not only enriches teachers' teaching tools and supports them in their teaching activities with technology, but also provides a better learning environment for students. The new teaching materials produced to meet the new curriculum reform, in the case of the new NPCA version, have a wide variety of technical software and a large percentage of them. It is evident that great importance is attached to the use of appropriate information technology in the mathematics classroom. This experimental study is guided by theory. Firstly, the author investigates examples of the effective integration of information technology in the classroom by finding relevant information on the current use of Matlab software in the classroom. The current status of students' learning of exponential and logarithmic functions is then investigated to analyse the current problems in learning functions. Interviews are conducted with outstanding teachers to understand the current state of teaching exponential and logarithmic functions from the teacher's perspective. The investigation and analysis lead to the identification of topics for research: graphs and properties of exponential functions, graphs and properties of logarithmic functions, and approximate solutions to equations by the dichotomous method. Guided by constructivist learning theory and knowledge transfer theory, the Matlab software is designed to incorporate the teaching process of exponential and logarithmic functions. Two classes from Hefei H Secondary School were used to carry out teaching, analyse the effects of the experiment and reflect on the shortcomings. Artificial Intelligence (Artificial nteliqence), or Al for short, is a new technical science that researches and develops theories, methods, technologies and application systems for simulating, extending and expanding human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is the study of the use of computers to simulate certain human thought processes and intelligent behaviours (e.g., learning, reasoning, thinking, planning, etc.), mainly including the principles of computer-implemented intelligence, the manufacture of computers similar to the intelligence of the human brain, so that computers can achieve a higher level of application. Artificial intelligence will involve the disciplines of computer science, psychology, philosophy and linguistics. Artificial Intelligence is an important part of the discipline of Intelligence, and research in this area includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, natural language processing and expert systems.  © 2024 ACM.","Computer technology; Dichotomy; Exponential functions; Mathematical modelling","Boolean functions; Cleaning; Computational linguistics; Curricula; Cutting; Exponential functions; Mean square error; Mechanical stability; Monte Carlo methods; Rational functions; Students; System stability; Teaching; Thermodynamic stability; 'current; Computer technology; Dichotomy; Exponentials; Logarithmic functions; Mathematical modeling; Matlab- software; Modern information technologies; Student learning; Teachers'; MATLAB","Association for Computing Machinery","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209122311"

Consequently, these applications of AI and others have proliferated aspects of daily life. Notably, there is a growing interest in incorporating AI to enhance K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research. To be effectively integrated, however, AI usage needs to align with teachers' existing STEM curriculum and pedagogy. In essence, the extent to which AI will be deployed in future classrooms will heavily depend on teachers' perceptions of its utility within the STEM education context. STEM teachers' attitudes, expectations, and perceived challenges regarding AI can significantly influence their willingness to adopt AI-integrated instruction approaches. Identifying and categorizing teachers' beliefs, motivational factors, and areas of concern will provide practical insights for STEM curriculum designers, professional developers, and policymakers. This study investigates these possible directions through a lens of major established models of integrated STEM education. Although extensive research has been done on integrating AI with STEM, work is lacking that translates this concept into concrete entry points for integration. To address this gap, this research uses a systematic literature review (SLR) approach focusing on preservice teachers' (PSTs') perceptions of AI in STEM education. Using the PRISMA model, we gathered related empirical, peer-reviewed articles published from 2020 to 2024. Of the 250 initial studies, 26 met our eventual criteria. Content analyses of these surveys revealed several aspects that may be used to further understand PSTs' perspectives on AI's involvement and potential usage in integrated STEM. Firstly, their competency using AI tools appears to greatly influence their attitude toward AI-integrated STEM pedagogy. Second, their perceptions of AI's effectiveness, utility, and ethics seem to significantly impact their willingness to adopt AI for classroom usage. Lastly, research suggests that PSTs recognize both the benefits, like improving student engagement and personalized learning, and the challenges posed by technical difficulties or the complexity of interspersing these technologies in their STEM classrooms. As such, teacher education related to meaningfully using AI tools is an important focus of integrating AI. Teachers must be skilled and confident in using AI tools in their classrooms, while also able to recognize its limitations and potential pitfalls. PSTs, therefore, need access to targeted AI resources and opportunities for application within their STEM pedagogy courses. Meeting these goals means providing teacher educators and researchers with ongoing support to advance the integration of AI into K-12 STEM education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","artificial intelligence; pre-service teacher; STEM education; systematic literature review","Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Economics; Engineering education; Engineering research; Ethical aspects; Public policy; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Engineering and mathematics; Mathematics education; Preservice teachers; Science education; Science teachers; Science technologies; Systematic literature review; Teachers'; Teachers' perceptions; Technology education; Curricula","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202042917"

Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students’ computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students’ computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.

However, the lack of relevant textbooks and learning resources has made its implementation challenging. Developing interdisciplinary knowledge graphs tailored for STEM education has become an urgent issue. To address this, a knowledge extraction framework named Llms4edu is proposed, which utilizes a series of effective prompts to guide large language models in knowledge extraction. Specifically, the knowledge extraction task is transformed into multiple rounds of question-and-answer interactions with the LLM, gradually identifying entity-relation triplets from subject data. Through experiments, an F1-score of 89.4% was achieved on the named entity recognition task in the chemistry subject, and an F1-score of 66.7% on the relation extraction task. Finally, a subject ontology model was built for subject text, and a subject data set was constructed using Llms4edu, which includes three subjects of junior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry, a total of 2,511 entities, 2,010 relationship triples, and cross-disciplinary knowledge is linked to construct a cross-disciplinary knowledge graph. © 2024 IEEE.","interdisciplinary knowledge graph; large language model; prompt engineering","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Cross-disciplinary; F1 scores; Graph extractions; Interdisciplinary knowledge graph; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Prompt engineering; STEM education; Knowledge graph","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215598070"

The problem studied belongs to euclidean geometry, and it is characterized by not admitting a single and immediate answer. It consists of dividing a circle into three surfaces of any dimension but with equal area. The categories for analysis are type of cut, representation system, level of mathematical validation and resolution type. We concluded that GAI offers inconsistent responses, little variety of answers, with few mathematical validations and with a predominance of a colloquial representation system. The teachers’ answers are correct, they offer a great variety of partitions, the predominant representation systems are geometric, graphic and arithmetic ones, and they offer some type of validation. It is concluded that the use of GAI models are not appropriate for this type of problems, without any critical reasoning. © 2025 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

To expedite the identification and recognition of this condition, enabling timely psychological intervention, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being considered. This research does not assert the feasibility of an AI system managing all aspects of chronic stress’s impact. However, it highlights the capability of current technology to detect stress indicators based on quantifiable data like Heart Rate (HR) and organizational climate dimensions. Although other physiological markers such as oximetry, skin galvanic response, and EKG have been explored, they have not shown reliable differentiation between stress and joy. Focused on the unique context of school principals in the Bedouin region of Israel, this study investigates the interplay between HR, organizational climate, and stress levels. It introduces a novel application of a fuzzy logic tool that combines HR and organizational climate metrics to aid in stress diagnosis. This tool incorporates the psychologist’s expertise to provide real-time data crucial for developing effective coping strategies. While the AI-supported fuzzy system does not replace professional psychological intervention, it significantly enhances the speed of condition identification and intervention planning, thus shortening the response time to stress-related issues in educational leadership within culturally specific settings. The application of such AI-driven tools is pivotal for sustaining the well-being and effectiveness of educational leaders, thereby supporting the broader goal of educational sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.","burnout; fuzzy; heart rate; high school principals’ well-being; organizational climate; stress","Israel; artificial intelligence; education; fuzzy mathematics; leadership; psychology; recognition; study perspective; sustainability","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202606066"

This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, aims to explore the relationship between math anxiety and the intention to use AI for solving math problems among high school students. Using the Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the AI Problem-Solving Behavior Scale (AIPS), data from 391 high school students were collected. The analysis revealed the following: (1) Students report high levels of math anxiety and a strong inclination to use AI tools for solving math problems; (2) Social support plays a significant role in alleviating math anxiety, with family support being the most effective, followed by support from friends and teachers; (3) High levels of family support are the most effective means of reducing math anxiety. The study suggests that the relationship between math anxiety and AI use intention should be addressed, with a focus on regulating the application of AI in math education to promote its scientific and effective use. Additionally, improving family relationships and providing mental health support are recommended to alleviate math anxiety from an emotional and social support perspective.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an RET Site under CISE at Auburn University (AU) in Alabama. The title of the research project is ""RET Site: Project-Based Learning for Rural Alabama STEM Middle School Teachers in Machine Learning and Robotics"", and this project provides engaging research experiences to middle and high school science teachers from primarily rural and underserved school districts in Alabama. In-service teachers (7th and 8th grade) participate in a 6-week summer professional development program with an emphasis on machine learning and AI. In addition, to the summer professional development institute teachers lead a weeklong summer camp for middle school students where they have an opportunity to implement curriculum modules they have developed and the project team provides support for teachers to implement the curriculum modules during the academic year as well. Providing consistent support and professional development for teachers in underserved school districts is essential for preparing students with the 21st century skills they will need to engage in an increasingly technological society. This is also essential for broadening participation in STEM for students from traditionally underrepresented populations. Engaging teachers' innovative content (e.g. AI, machine learning, robotics) enhances their pedagogical content knowledge and provides them the skills to better prepare their students to become scientists, engineers, innovators, and entrepreneurs in these areas. As part of this RET project, teachers explore various research topics alongside faculty mentors' and learn how to connect their science and mathematics objectives to machine learning, mobile robot, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality concepts and develop curriculum modules using this content. Teachers also engage with science education researchers to better understand how to make the science content more relevant to their students' daily lives. Teachers enhanced their knowledge in inquiry-based, hands-on research pedagogical strategies and structured and designed their lessons through a lens of project-based learning. Key to this project was demonstrating how leveraging an innovative platform of ML-based mobile robots can be friendly and easily accessible to teachers. This project also fosters strong collaborations between in-service teachers, and engineering and STEM education faculty. Program participants for yr2 included seven teachers, one male and six females. Of the seven teacher participants four identified as African American, two identified as white, and one participant identified as biracial. Surveys instruments included the Project Knowledge Scale, the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS), Computer Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale all used to measure teachers' knowledge, attitudes, computer, and teaching self-efficacy changes pre and post surveys were disseminated to program participates during the summer 6-week professional development institute.

We interviewed twenty-four primary and secondary school mathematics teachers in the Northern Cape province about their use of DGBL. Inductive thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. The findings revealed that external variables such as language barriers, teachers’ technophobia, parental influence, and students’ limited reading skills negatively influenced teachers’ perceived usefulness of digital games. We also found that the teachers’ attitudes toward DGBL, which were influenced by their positive perception of it, influenced their intention to use digital games for mathematics purposes.

Traditional online or distance math tutoring can treat learning as disembodied, and not give learners access to embodied resources like gestures, movements, and actions. Virtual Reality offers important opportunities for students joining from a distance to utilize virtual bodies in a fully immersive world, where students can also interact with dynamic mathematical objects. In the present study, we examined 20 middle school students engaging in a VR-based distance tutoring intervention over 7 weeks. We found some preliminary promising indications for the effect of the intervention on students’ mathematical learning, compared to a control group which received VR-based tutoring in English-Language Arts. By systematically qualitatively coding videos of students and tutors engaged in math tutoring, we identified affordances of the VR environment—including the use of gestures and whole-body movements related to students' mathematical reasoning, the presence of mathematical play in the environment, and unique interactions with dimensionality in the 3D space. We also found important constraints from our thematic coding of the interactions in the videos—including connection problems, issues with spatial orientation and virtual body positioning, and off-task or distracted students in the VR environment. We close with recommendations for future VR-based tutoring interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.","Dynamic geometry software; Embodied learning; Mathematics education; Tutoring; Virtual reality","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Affordances; Dynamic geometry softwares; Embodied learning; Immersive; Mathematical objects; Mathematics education; Middle school students; Tutoring; Virtual bodies; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual environments","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001486363"

Specifically, the authors sought to understand the level of AI literacy among university students, the extent of their prior exposure to AI education, and the factors that affect their AI education. The study was conducted through an online survey distributed among 300 university students at a Korean university. The study findings indicate that most university students are interested in learning AI. Moreover, the results showed that students with prior experience with software (SW) education showed superior knowledge, a better grasp of AI concepts, and more confidence in using AI technologies, especially in computer coding skills. On the other hand, students with less exposure to prior AI education expressed a need for more learning opportunities and sufficient knowledge of computer coding skills. In addition, we found that students who had received SW education during their K-12 schooling showed better math skills than those who had only received short-term training in university. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the educational barriers that impede university students’ ability to harness this interest effectively. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into university students’ perceptions regarding AI literacy and the factors that affect their AI education. © 2024 by authors.","AI; AI education; AI literacy; higher education; university students","","Bastas","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205249549"

Extensive efforts are undergone to improve education at the K-12 level, but even at the university level educators are struggling to keep pace with the development of AI. At the same time, a continuous stream of presentations in digital media reveal an unbroken fascination with industrial robots, even though their emergence dates back decades. Our approach to stimulate students' interest in AI education leverages the appeal of physical interaction with an AI via a 6-DOF robot rather than an auditory or purely visual interface. In order to keep access to robot programming as a hurdle as low as possible, we expand the graphic programming ability of an industrial robot user interface with a self-designed game-card concept and combine this with an AI hard-and software that is either pre-trained or trained as part of a problem-solving exercise. We present a step-by-step approach for artificial intelligence in education (AIED) that is characterized by increasing complexity of the exercises and can therefore be adapted to offer different levels of interactive learning environments (ILE). Part of this step-by-step approach is also the presentation of the development of information processing from strictly linear (the robot control) via object-oriented (in the interaction of the AI with the robot) to the AI itself in an overall project that combines all stages and concepts. This interactive learning environment thus enables an adjustment in both the level of difficulty and-by selecting the sub-areas-the amount of time in teaching the application of AI in a real-world scenario. © 2024, Pixel Associazione.

Such experiences are also an important way to attract more students to STEM careers. Currently however, the number of high-quality STEM education resources and materials available to preschool educators is limited. This is particularly the situation in areas of high poverty in communities that have been under-resourced longitudinally. This research addresses a gap in preschool teachers' capacity to support young children's STEM content knowledge by determining what sorts of technology is present in children's home, and how such technological experiences impact children's familiarization with and use of technology in preschool classrooms for children ages three-five. The presented study is part of a larger, National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project in which preschoolers, their teachers and their families experience an intervention to improve children's access to technology and experience in pre-engineering and early computer science education with their early childhood teachers. The referenced “umbrella” study's research questions include: (1) In what ways does the project's infusing of play-based early computer science and pre-engineering into child development programs impact young children's early computer science and pre-engineering knowledge, and their knowledge of and early interest in STEM careers? (2) What is the relationship between the project's teacher professional development and participating teachers' content knowledge of early computer science and pre-engineering and instructional performance? (3) What impact does the teachers' cyber-safety focused professional development have on the cyber-safe practices of participating preschool teachers and their young students? And (4) What role do young students' early technology experiences play in their comfort with, interest in, and understanding of technology use? The full research project referenced above employs a teacher professional development program that allows preschool educators and university STEM faculty to co-create materials and engage in teacher professional development together. This is “work in progress” research during its second year in operation with NSF funding. In the first year of the project, the research team engaged in research on the needs of teachers in diverse early childhood education settings. These results were presented last year (2023) at ASEE. This 2024 ASEE paper responds to the fourth research question (above) of the referenced larger early education study regarding children's use of and comfort with technology. This question was included in the research because the literature suggests that frequency of use of technology and familiarization with technology increases young students' interest in STEM majors in college and careers; so as researchers, we wish to determine the level of interest, experience and comfort with technology young children have in their homes and how that may impact their in-class technology familiarization and use. This is of particular importance for the population engaged with this research because 92.3% of them are considered under-resourced financially by federal poverty standards. For the present paper, we collected research data using a family/primary caregiver questionnaire on the use of technology in children's home who are in the preschools in which the teacher participants for the larger study teach. This questionnaire collected information about the types of technology the children have in their homes, whether the young children in the families witnessed use of the technology, (a proxy for learning vicariously from about technology), whether they used the technology themselves, and then compared that information to the children's use, familiarization and comfort with using technology in their preschool classroom. Results of this research indicated that the majority of the preschool children had only experiences using a smart phone or television, either vicariously or directly. Nearly 100% of the children had access to television. Of those who had smart phones in their home 64.1 percent had direct experience playing with a smart phone. Only 26% of the children had experiences with computers and these experiences were primarily vicarious, watching either a parent, other adult, or an older sibling using a computer. Very few children used a robot at home, a few had access to an e-tablet, and a very small number of children had access to musical technology. The connections to use in the classroom were rather profound. Of those who used technology other than a TV, the more frequent and the variability in technology use, the more comfortable the children were with in-class technology use per their families. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Engineering research; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Temperature scales; Computer science engineerings; Engineering and mathematics; Pre-engineering; Science technologies; Smart phones; Teacher professional development; Teachers'; Technology use; Under-resourced; Young children; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202060971"

In the 2020 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to the President of the USA, PCAST has recommended a set of bold actions to help ensure continued leadership in IotF, comprising artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), advanced manufacturing, advanced communications, and biotechnology. In summer 2023, the first cohort of 8 preservice teachers (PST) from the UH teachHOUSTON (tH) PST program participated in the RE-PST program at UH Cullen College of Engineering (CCOE). This six-week program, open to high school STEM PSTs in the tH program, sought to advance future educators' knowledge of concepts in IotF as a means of enriching high school curriculums defined in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standard. Six UH CCOE professors each led workshops in a week. Five research mentors, assisted by student research assistants, mentored PSTs on various projects. The group also participated in field trips to local companies including Samson Controls, TechnipFMC, Beckhoff Automation, and SLB (Schlumberger). They worked with the professors in the teachHOUSTON on applying their knowledge learned to lesson plan design. Participants met weekly for Brown Bag teacher seminars to share their experiences and discuss curricula. On the final day of the program, the PSTs presented their curriculum prototype for their future field teaching to the group and received completion certificates. This summer is special in that this cohort of 8 PSTs participated in some activities together with 15 high school in-service teachers in the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at UH. The common activities include one day workshop in SolidWorks design, field trips, and some curriculum development sessions. Two research mentors mentored both PST and in-service teachers. PST participants found the research experience with their mentors beneficial not only to them, but also to their future students according to our findings from interviews.

Regarding education, no matter how updated we are in relation to the contents, didactic strategies, and technological resources, we are still inevitably forced to adapt to new paradigms, leading us to reformulate traditional teaching methods. In this context, the contribution of e-learning platforms emerges, where teachers and students have at their disposal new means of empowering the teaching and learning process, since these platforms can be defined as a virtual teaching support environments. Currently, our students, in general, have many difficulties in problem-solving and mathematical reasoning, which often reflects in the performance of very simple tasks, with a growing disinterest towards Mathematics. It is also possible to argue that our students' ""poor preparation"" is a contributing factor in their failure (many did not attend Mathematics in Secondary Education and/or have not studied for several years, as is the case of those who entered through special contingents, as the “aged 23 and over”). In order to promote a distinct, alternative and supportive pathway that may help to solve this issue, a project on the Moodle learning management system (LMS) platform has been developed with the goal of assisting students in their study and the development of their skills in a way that is directly related to the curricular units (CU) in the scientific field of Mathematics, in an online learning environment. To increase students’ engagement into their learning process in a collaborative environment, a flipped model was employed into a Financial Mathematics/Financial Calculus Course (FCC). This paper's primary goal is to examine the effects of implementing the flipped classroom paradigm on students' performance, learning, and classroom instruction. The results from employing this approach have indicated a beneficial effect on the overall academic progress of students. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

Yet traditional teaching methods often lack the implementation of games in general, and of digital games in particular. This study presents a unique constructivist framework for creating and integrating digital-game generators in the classroom, following four consecutive year-long courses for preservice teachers at a college in Israel. Using design-based research, year-to-year improvements (iterations) to the course were introduced, achieved through analysis of in-class discussions, semi-structured interviews, participants' reflective diaries and the generated games. The participants were required to apply the constructivist framework to a study unit in their field of expertise, during their practical school-teaching experience. The findings in this study are based on the participants' teaching experience in secondary schools in three core subjects: English as a second language, mathematics and history. The developed consecutive framework comprises three core elements: the game, the pedagogical and didactic core, and the knowledge—all of which are important when integrating digital-game generators into the classroom. The course and framework addressed in this study could be applied in additional teacher-training programs, to increase digital-game generation and related skills in classrooms. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Creating and implementing digital games in the classroom has gained momentum in recent years. Early exposure of preservice teachers to digital games during the teaching training phase may increase their use in the educational field. The developing and integration of digital games in the classroom, based on the constructivist approach, allows students to create games using existing game generators, while expressing their insights and knowledge in a personal and creative manner. What this paper adds Introduces an innovative framework integrating educational game generation into teacher training, addressing key pedagogical and content knowledge components. Demonstrates the successful application of this framework across multiple disciplines (English, mathematics and history) in secondary education. Presents a longitudinal study showcasing the iterative development and refinement of a game-based learning approach in preservice teacher education. Provides evidence-based insights into the effectiveness of incorporating digital game creation as a constructivist learning tool in teacher preparation programs. Implications for practice and/or policy The constructivist framework helps expose preservice teachers—and in early stages of their teacher training—to experimenting with different types of digital games and different methods for integrating them into their teaching.

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students' passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers' responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Dispositional Data; Feedback; Formative Peer Assessment; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Trace Data","Dispositional data; Formative assessment; Formative peer assessment; Generative artificial intelligence; Peer assessment; Peer feedback; Student learning; Teaching practices; Time constraints; Trace data; Contrastive Learning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000391566"

Spatial ability is a skill needed in many fields, such as science, mathematics, engineering, and architecture. Since this ability can be improved through training, this study adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of an artificial intelligence-supported 5E (AI-s5E) instructional model on students’ spatial visualization, spatial relationships, and spatial orientation performances that explain their spatial abilities. A total of 43 students from two classes at a secondary school in western Turkey were recruited to participate in this study. One of the classes was the experimental group (f = 23), which adopted the AI-s5E approach, and the other class was the control group (f = 20), which adopted the traditional teaching model. The results showed that the integration of the AI-s5E instructional approach into education improved students’ spatial abilities and sub-dimensions. In light of the findings, it can be recommended that AI applications, which have a positive and significant impact on spatial skills, can be integrated into teachers’ lessons and even included in curriculum programs. © 2024 by the authors.","5E instructional; artificial intelligence (AI); spatial ability (SA)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202509423"

Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China’s Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the “black box” nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students’ learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice. © 2024 by the authors.","assessment methods; computer-based assessment; mathematics item difficulty; secondary education; SHAP; XGBoost","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194070698"

The selection of the incorrect qualification increases the risk of dropping out, changing qualifications, or not finishing the qualification enrolled in the minimum time. This study harnesses a real-world dataset comprising student records across four engineering disciplines from the 2016 and 2017 academic years at a public South African university. The study examines the relative importance of features in models for predicting student performance and determining whether students are better suited for extended or mainstream programmes. The study employs a three-step methodology, encompassing data pre-processing, feature importance selection, and model training with evaluation, to predict student performance by addressing issues such as dataset imbalance, biases, and ethical considerations. By relying exclusively on high school performance data, predictions are based solely on students’ abilities, fostering fairness and minimising biases in predictive tasks. The results show that removing demographic features like ethnicity or nationality reduces bias. The study’s findings also highlight the significance of the following features: mathematics, physical sciences, and admission point scores when predicting student performance. The models are evaluated, demonstrating their ability to provide accurate predictions. The study’s results highlight varying performance among models and their key contributions, underscoring the potential to transform academic advising and enhance student decision-making.

However, there are still challenges in the way math is taught through video games, such as insufficient adaptation to diverse learning styles and limited flexibility in topic selection. These limitations have created a need for configurable video games that can be tailored to meet specific learning objectives while engaging students in an enjoyable and interactive manner. In response to the demand for more adaptable educational tools, this study introduces 'Dino Math Legacy', a customizable video game designed to reinforce math learning for first-year high school students, aligned with Peru's National Basic Education Curriculum. Teachers have the ability to tailor the game to specific learning goals, ensuring engagement through interactive and enjoyable experiences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a video game in improving math learning for first-year high school students, focusing on its impact on engagement and learning outcomes. A mixed-methods evaluation confirmed the game's positive impact on learning outcomes and its successful integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, which enhance user experience and learning. Additionally, the study found that the game improved math learning by incorporating dynamic and interactive features, such as adaptive problem-solving challenges, tailored to individual learning styles. The game's customizable features allowed teachers to modify content and set specific learning objectives, which enhanced student motivation and improved comprehension of key math concepts. The research highlights the potential of educational video games in classroom learning, emphasizing the importance of aligning design with student learning styles. A user-centered design approach, guided by educational psychologists and frameworks like LEGA and LM-GM, ensured effectiveness.

However, in mathematics education, which is strongly connected to prerequisite knowledge, it is difficult to objectively identify where weaknesses arise. Therefore, it is considered increasingly important to provide learning support that enables students to understand their own comprehension status and to decide on the next learning units or problems to tackle. In this study, we propose a method to support learners in identifying their learning weaknesses and selecting problems to work on in mathematics education by marking the weakness level and subjective comprehension status on a Task Analysis chart. The implementation of this method in high school classes showed that considering subjective comprehension status allowed students to recognize areas of uncertain understanding and gain new insights into their learning weaknesses. Additionally, displaying the weakness level on the Task Analysis chart was suggested to be helpful in deciding which problems to work on next. © 2024 IEEE.","Learning task analysis; Mathematics education; Self-directed learning","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Job analysis; Self-supervised learning; Informatization; Learning task analyze; Learning tasks; Mathematics education; School education; Self-directed learning; Strongly connected; Support mechanism; Support method; Task analysis; Federated learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217044640"

Based on teachers’ perceptions, the study analyses the value of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and historical science narratives to address the complex relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The analysis reveals a disjointed narrative hindering students’ understanding during the critical transition phase, emphasising the insufficiency of a single lesson, ‘Atom and Newton’s Mechanics’ at the academic year’s end. The proposed comprehensive methodology for curriculum revision aims to seamlessly integrate historical narratives into the educational framework, providing a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness between classical and quantum mechanics. The discussion emphasises the potential positive impacts on student engagement, comprehension and enthusiasm for physics, extending beyond content adjustments to transform pedagogical strategies. The conclusion highlights the broader significance of these changes for science education, suggesting a curriculum overhaul informed by historical narratives and AI integration could shape a generation of scientifically literate individuals, adept at navigating contemporary physics complexities. The article serves as a call to action for teachers, curriculum developers and policymakers to innovate high school science education in line with the dynamic nature of scientific discovery. © 2025 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).","artificial intelligence; classical mechanics; historical framework; Physics education; quantum mechanics","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000458340"

Many researchers have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) to develop models and systems for automatic analysis and feedback. However, the question of whether we should employ these AIoT tools on automatic transcripts of classroom dialogue generated by automatic speech recognition software or on transcripts that have undergone human revision remains unresolved, which involves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Thus, this paper examines whether perfect transcripts are needed to analyze talk moves in classroom dialogue. We initially constructed two deep learning models to analyze teacher talk moves in K-12 mathematics lessons. Subsequently, we collected an additional set of six K-12 mathematics lesson videos and used a classroom dialogue analysis system equipped with speech recognition software to automatically transcribe them, resulting in ASR_pure transcripts. These transcripts were then manually revised and verified to create ASR_human transcripts. A comparison between the two types of transcripts revealed evident errors in the ASR_pure transcripts. Next, we employed the developed AI models to predict talk moves in both ASR_pure and ASR_human transcripts and assessed their consistency. The findings demonstrate a high level of consistency in talk move prediction between the two types of transcripts across the six lessons. Furthermore, the ASR_pure transcripts also exhibit high consistency in specific talk moves (e.g., pressing for accuracy) when compared to ASR_human transcripts. We propose a hypothesis that this consistency between inaccurate ASR_pure transcripts and perfect ASR_human transcripts can be attributed to the ASR software accurately recognizing key indicators that serve as talk moves, rather than accurately identifying every word. Notably, upon removing the key indicator words from teacher utterances, both the talk move level and lesson level consistency experience a substantial decline. Therefore, we suggest that perfect transcripts of classroom dialogue may not be necessary for AIoT to analyze teacher talk moves and provide teachers with prompt and accurate feedback, especially when the ASR software can accurately recognize keywords. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence in education; Classroom dialogue; Education and AIoT; Talk move; Transcript","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183962945"

Forming this kind of personality is one of the objectives of general secondary education institutions. Creating an educational environment that allows every student to realize their potential is impossible without innovative technologies, among which immersive technologies stand out as some of the most progressive. The use of immersive technologies in the educational process for high school students makes this process dynamic and engaging due to the interactivity of such technologies and their high level of visual representation. In Ukraine’s secondary education system, the practice of implementing immersive technologies has demonstrated their effectiveness by increasing motivation to learn, which, in turn, has led to better academic performance. This study focuses on the use of immersive technologies in the teaching of mathematics to high school students in general secondary education institutions. Scientific literature highlights four main topics regarding the use of immersive technologies in education: 1) the impact of immersive technologies on learning outcomes; 2) the use of immersive technologies for learning and simulation; 3) the influence of immersive technologies on interaction and user engagement; 4) ethical and social implications of immersive technologies. In Ukrainian secondary education institutions, platforms for immersive learning include developments from both Ukraine and other countries. These platforms, such as AR Book, mozaBook, GeoGebra, and Desmos, are user-friendly, require no software installation, allow interaction with educational materials, and include both pre-designed tasks and the ability for students to create their own projects. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","AR Book; Desmos; general secondary education institutions; GeoGebra; high school students; immersive learning platforms; immersive tools for teaching mathematics; mozaBook","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economic geology; Educational technology; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Teaching; AR book; Desmos; Education institutions; General secondary education institution; Geogebrum; High school students; Immersive; Immersive learning; Immersive learning platform; Immersive tool for teaching mathematic; Learning platform; Mozabook; Students","CEUR-WS","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217845883"

A critique of data science courseware cites the lack of ""author proximity,""in which students do not contribute to the data's production or see their personal experiences reflected in the data. This paper introduces a novel data science curriculum to scaffold middle and high school students in undertaking real-world data science practices. Through project-based learning modules, the curriculum engages students in investigating solutions to community-based problems through visualization and analysis of live sensor data and public data sets. Materials include formative assessments to help educators (especially those from non-math and computing backgrounds) measure their students' abilities to identify statistical patterns, critically evaluate data biases, and make predictions.

Second, 15 variables were identified as significant predictors of mathematical literacy across the student population, particularly variables such as mathematics self-efficacy (MATHEFF) and expected occupational status (BSMJ). Third, mathematics self-efficacy was determined to be the most influential factor. Fourth, the factors influencing mathematical literacy vary among individual students, including the key influencing factors, the direction (positive or negative) of their impact, and the extent of this influence.

Therefore, schools cannot scale their programs to meet the criteria needed to teach engineering effectively. As a result, many teachers hold common misconceptions about what engineers do and have low self-efficacy with teaching engineering, leading to a lack of interest in engineering among K-12 students. Research indicates that students tend to hold stereotypical and narrow perceptions of engineering, which in turn limits their interest in engineering as a future career choice. Previous research indicates that to improve engineering literacy in the United States and support the professional formation of engineers, there is a critical need to provide engineering education training to pre-service teachers, especially those mathematics and science teachers who are most likely to be teaching standalone engineering courses and other related courses where engineering practices can be most effectively integrated into the curriculum. However, there are currently very few colleges of education that provide any training to prepare pre-service teachers to teach engineering. In this study, pre-service teachers and engineering undergraduate students worked together to learn about engineering education and develop engineering-focused activities for use in K-12 classrooms. A new course model was created that utilized a hybrid community of practice where students learned about engineering education and worked together to support local K-12 schools by engaging in service learning. This project explored the ways in which participation in this course impacted pre-service teachers' perceptions of engineering and engineering teaching self-efficacy. We first administered a survey designed to measure engineering teaching self-efficacy to pre-service teachers at the beginning and end of the course. In addition, pre-service teachers also completed reflective journals throughout the course in which they were asked to reflect on how specific aspects of the course impacted their understanding of the nature of engineering and their confidence in their ability to teach engineering. They were also asked to reflect on their confidence in their ability to teach engineering in the future and on how their perceptions of engineering and self-efficacy had changed after participating in the course. All reflective journals were analyzed qualitatively using an open coding method to identify common themes in the responses. The quantitative survey results demonstrated that the engineering teaching self-efficacy of pre-service teachers increased after participating in this course. Furthermore, in reflective journals, students indicated that they felt more confident in their ability to teach engineering by the end of the course, with many saying that they now had a better understanding of engineering as a field and how to teach it than they had before. Participants also stated that they felt like more exposure to engineering and training on how to teach engineering would further increase their self-efficacy and willingness to teach engineering in K-12. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Personnel training; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Communities of Practice; Education training; Engineering teachings; K-12 teachers; Perceptions of engineering; Preservice teachers; Prior experience; Reflective journals; Self efficacy; Teachers'; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202014308"

The advent of AI technology has made comprehensive and in-depth teaching evaluation possible, serving as a significant driving force for efficient and precise teaching. There were few empirical studies on the application of high-quality precision teaching models in the field of compulsory education, and the learning difficulty of technology and the teaching burden on teachers have become significant factors hindering the use of technology to support education. This study analyzed teaching models from the perspectives of teachers’ teaching burdens and students’ learning obstacles, and was committed to relying on intelligent technology to construct a new precision teaching model, an educational diagnosis–feedback–intervention path that covered the entire teaching process, from the dimensions of teacher behavior, student behavior, and parent behavior, aiming to assist teachers in efficient teaching and students in personalized learning. This study was conducted with nine science classes, including about 540 people in the second year of high school at a Middle School in China; six classes were the intervention groups while the last three classes were control groups, and a survey of 19 teachers from the intervention classes was carried out. The results showed that this model can significantly improve students’ academic performance in science subjects, especially in mathematics and chemistry. It has increased the proportion of high-achieving students, reduced the proportion of low-achieving students, stimulated students’ self-directed learning ability, cultivated a positive attitude towards science learning, and explained the key points of using a precision teaching model in different disciplines. It has achieved a deep integration of education and technology, helping to increase the efficiency and reduce the burden of teaching. © 2024 by the authors.","AI technology; individualized development; intelligent education system; personalized learning; precision teaching","Adversarial machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Educational technology; Federated learning; Students; AI Technologies; Education systems; Higher School; Individualized development; Intelligent education system; Intelligent educations; Personalized learning; Precision teaching; Teachers'; Teaching model; Contrastive Learning","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203853050"

The duration varies from 30 min to a class-long and beyond, going into a series of class meetings to finish an activity. A lot of content is focused on the school subject topics. Some of those subjects, like mathematics, physics, and chemistry are present in both high school and college. Others, like some types of engineering, have no direct link to the school subjects. One example is manufacturing engineering and manufacturing engineering technology. When students are unaware of the manufacturing possibilities, they end up selecting the different career paths, which is the negative scenario for the United States domestic manufacturing efforts. The authors designed a series of high school activities that would introduce students to the topics of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). The goals of the activities are to a) raise student awareness and stimulate interest in the topics and b) inspire students to pursue a degree in a new manufacturing-related college major at a Midwestern university. The authors collected information on the existing activities from different sources, such as the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) website, different professional education websites of the top engineering universities in the United States, and others. The authors worked with the leadership from the Midwestern university's academia-industry collaboration center and select manufacturing industry stakeholders to retrieve additional activities. The content of the activities can provide students with the knowledge and skills that are essential for them to have in the 21st century economy. The designed activities can be useful for both the practitioners in the field and higher education institutions, who seek to inspire and recruit future talents to underrepresented fields like manufacturing. The structure of the designed activities can be used to design additional activities and align them with appropriate I4.0 competencies. The potential deployment of the activities in high school classrooms will help meet the United States strategic goal of supporting domestic manufacturing efforts and raising its competitiveness on the world market. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Computer-Aided Design (CAD); Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE); Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM); Cost-Benefit Analysis; Data Analytics; Engineering; Engineering Technology; Industry 4.0 (I4.0); K-12; Lean Manufacturing; Machine Learning (ML); Manufacturing; Smart Manufacturing; STEM; Undergraduate","Agile manufacturing systems; Behavioral research; Cost engineering; Curricula; Design for manufacturability; Engineering education; Smart manufacturing; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Web Design; Artificial intelligence; Computer-aided design; Computer-aided engineering; Computer-aided manufacturing; Cost-benefits analysis; Data analytics; Industry 4.0; K-12; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Smart manufacturing; STEM; Undergraduate; Students","American Society for Engineering Education","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202059257"

Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering. © 2021 American Society for Engineering Education.","analytics; diversity; engineering major choice; engineering pathways; high school; quantitative","Decision trees; Engineering education; Population statistics; Random forests; Analytic; Demographic factors; Diversity; Engineering major choice; Engineering pathway; Higher School; Predictive power; Quantitative; Random forests; Student demographics; Students","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107973553"

Yet, our scientific understanding of the way teacher practices around AI tutors mediate student learning is far from complete. In this paper, we investigate spatiotemporal factors of student-teacher interactions by analyzing student engagement and learning with an AI tutor ahead of teacher visits (defined as episodes of a teacher being in close physical proximity to a student) and immediately following teacher visits. To conduct such integrated, temporal analysis around the moments when teachers visit students, we collect fine-grained, time-synchronized data on teacher positions in the physical classroom and student interactions with the AI tutor. Our case study in a K12 math classroom with a veteran math teacher provides some indications on factors that might affect a teacher’s decision to allocate their limited classroom time to their students and what effects these interactions have on students. For instance, teacher visits were associated more with students’ in-the-moment behavioral indicators (e.g., idleness) than a broader, static measure of student needs such as low prior knowledge. While teacher visits were often associated with positive changes in student behavior afterward (e.g., decreased idleness), there could be a potential mismatch between students visited by the teacher and who may have needed it more at that time (e.g., students who were disengaged for much longer). Overall, our findings indicate that teacher visits may yield immediate benefits for students but also that it is challenging for teachers to meet all needs – suggesting the need for better tool support. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Human-AI Partnership; Multimodality; Spatial analytics; Student Engagement; Teaching; Temporality","Artificial intelligence; Human-AI partnership; Multi-modality; Spatial analytic; Spatiotemporal analysis; Student engagement; Student learning; Student teachers; Teacher practices; Teachers'; Temporality; Students","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164931249"

To achieve this objective, machine learning algorithms such as the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were implemented. From a question bank containing 1,300 questions covering Algebra (A), Advanced Algebra (AA), Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (T), Analytic Geometry (AG), and Solid Mensuration (SM), five domain experts identified the suitability of the questions as part of a diagnostic examination in mathematics. Specifically, using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being the highest), the experts rated the suitability of each question to test the proficiency of a student in 23 mathematics competencies based on what is prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The collected survey data were then used to train the machine learning models, which extracted patterns to identify the questions that would be most suitable to test the mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students. With a precision recall score of 99.90%, the LR model was selected as the best performing model and analysis of how the LR model predicts the labels through the use of shap values revealed that the preference was given towards questions which test student proficiency in foundational mathematics competencies like that of Algebra and Analytical Geometry. Overall, these findings provided a better understanding of the questions that are most effective in discriminating student deficiencies in mathematics subjects.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Adaptive boosting; Algebra; Decision trees; Education computing; Geometry; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Baccalaureate program; First-year engineering; K-12 programs; Logistic Regression modeling; Logistics regressions; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Multiple-choice questions; Philippines; Random forests; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161803333"

In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students. The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands. Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments. In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.  © 2024 IEEE.","Learning Environments; machine learning techniques; Secondary School","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Education computing; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Information management; Integration; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Metadata; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Contextual information; Learning environments; Learning pathway; Machine learning techniques; Primary objective; Secondary schools; Socio-economics; Student assessment; Student's characteristics; Students","IEEE Computer Society","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199029802"

As K-12 education increasingly emphasizes STEM education and engagement, our project-based systems engineering curriculum aims to add to the existing body of effective instructional approaches for stronger collaboration, problem-solving, and engineering skills in students. We designed and tested our curriculum at Acera, an independent Massachusetts school for science, creativity, and leadership. Elementary school students at a four-day Acera camp participated in our systems engineering project: building a smart model of a LEGO city. Split into teams, students earned badges for developing skills such as Python coding, and Robotics as they ventured to build a school and a town hall, a transportation system, and even a renewable energy source. Our field observations and interviews revealed patterns of motivation and applications of systems thinking in our students. We found that gamification, badges, and earnable points both engaged and united students by rewarding growth in STEM skills and setting achievable, tangible, class-wide goals. Students encountered problems head-on, working on faulty code or missing railroad pieces without direction from an adult, demonstrating our project's facilitation of implicit motivation. Students also communicated across teams by suggesting new tasks, which was rewarded with class-wide points, or adjusting their own work based on the results of another team, demonstrating an adoption of systems thinking. All of their efforts culminated into a city of many moving parts-motorized trains, color-sensor cars, windmills, and conveyor belts. Each part was made by a different team, so each team had to collaborate across disciplines to create the LEGO city. © 2024 IEEE.","complex systems; engineering management; project management; systems engineering","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Curricula; Gamification; Large scale systems; Learning systems; Problem oriented languages; Railroad transportation; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Systems analysis; Systems thinking; Collaboration problems; Complex engineering; Engineering curriculum; Engineering management; Engineering program; K-12 education; Problem solving skills; Project-based; STEM education; System thinkings; Project management","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000812111"

The lack of understanding of key as-pects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incor-porate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technol-ogy, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families. © 2021 by the authors.

It is critical for significant economic prosperity to increase the number of STEM programs for youth. Researchers have examined the STEM fields racial and gender disparities because it is equally essential to have STEM workers from all racial/ethnic backgrounds and genders to influence the STEM pipeline. Many U.S. schools work to integrate more STEM-based curriculum in efforts to make improvements in education and career exploration. This has included restructuring educational standards and creating specific STEM programs throughout various communities. Students rely on technology every day without training about the connected career opportunities. To better prepare students to fill roles in the STEM workforce, there is a need to help students understand the connection between their secondary math and science coursework and STEM occupations. Since there tends to be a gap between education and career exploration, this study uses the foundational principles of the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to focus on behaviors and youth influences to explore the capacity of youth participants to influence their career exploration and perception towards STEM using the Mark Patrick Mahoney Attitudes and Perceptions towards STEM (APT) survey.

UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses, and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational and critical thinking. This research aims to design the DIA4K12 framework, which proposes the structure to support the teaching-learning process of AI in primary and secondary education. The core of the framework consists of four phases: planning, execution, process, and development; three components: open educational resources, K-12 curriculum and active methodologies; five sublevels: logical reasoning, computational thinking, and disconnected artificial intelligence, mathematics for AI, programming and machine learning; and three transversal axes: communities (communities of practice), open license (creative commons) and ethics. Finally, the framework was applied to a case study in the context of the Ecuadorian General Basic Education curriculum for the subject of Mathematics, using three phases, three components, and two sublevels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computational thinking; Education; Information technology education; Machine learning; School curriculum","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126199997"

Educational robotics is increasingly recognized as an effective teaching tool for enhancing students' interest in and proficiency in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). VEX Robotics is one of the most well-known, practical learning tools that allow students to showcase their programming abilities and creativity. However, little research has been done on how VEX robotics impact teaching practices and students' learning motivation from teachers' perspectives. While VEX robotics is widely utilized in educational environments for teaching robotics and programming concepts, more detailed research is needed to understand how its implementation influences student learning motivation, and overall teaching effectiveness. This study was conducted by interviewing teachers, who were experienced in using VEX in this pedagogical context at an international secondary school in Macao. In particular, the study focused on teachers' opinions about the impact of VEX robotics on students' learning motivation. Qualitative data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with robotic teachers, providing deeper insights into students' motivation and participation in the robotics environment. The study employed the ARCS model as a theoretical framework. The teachers' interview outputs were examined considering the model's four dimensions: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The findings highlighted that teachers valued the use of VEX robotics and believed that it increased students' motivation in all the dimensions of the ARCS model. © 2024 IEEE.","ARCS model; Educational robotics; K-12 education; Learning Motivation; STEM; VEX Robotics","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Educational robots; Robot learning; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Teaching; ARCS model; Educational robotics; K-12 education; Learning motivation; Science technologies; Science, technology, engineering, and math; Student learning motivations; Student motivation; Teachers'; VEX robotic; Robot programming","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000761194"

The performance of these models in certain areas, like Math problem solving is receiving a crescent attention as it directly impacts on its potential use in educational settings. Most of these evaluations, however, concentrate on the construction and use of benchmarks comprising diverse Math problems in English. In this work, we discuss the capabilities of most used LLMs within the subfield of Geometry, in view of the relevance of this subject in high-school curricula and the difficulties exhibited by even most advanced multimodal LLMs to deal with geometric notions. This work focuses on Spanish, which is additionally a less resourced language. The answers of three major chatbots, based on different LLMs, were analyzed not only to determine their capacity to provide correct solutions, but also to categorize the errors found in the reasoning processes described.

However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. Science identity has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students’ science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results: Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach’s alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions: Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student’s standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students’ science identity. © 2022, The Author(s).","High school students; Instrument; Measure; Science identity; STEM education; Validation","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129471764"

Not only they should experience an important exploratory process of choosing a department at the university but also they need to cultivate their career interest and career decision-making abilities for career preparation. However, there are few opportunities for students to actively explore their interests and integrate practical skills and hence most high school students have a huge cognitive gap between their interests in future career and their background knowledge. Therefore, this research uses the 6E model combined with the self-efficacy strategies in order to enable students to participate more actively in class discussions and complete their practical works with the help of their peers, thereby accumulating a sense of accomplishment and gaining better learning performance.

Teaching standards (e.g., for K-12 math education) align with such theories of learning. For instance, teachers are encouraged to have students “talk mathematics”, construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, model with mathematics, and use tools with precision, among others. Yet most learning technologies and tutoring systems are not designed to facilitate embodied learning; instead, they tend to align with more traditional views of student learning. This paper explores possible ways AIED systems can reflect embodied learning theories, within K-12 STEM education. We present the WearableLearning platform as an example that intends to bring embodied learning to mathematics and computing education for students at the K-12 level, with implications and suggestions on how to use Artificial Intelligence to make embodied learning environments more effective. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Embodied Learning; Learning in Motion; Math Games; Mobile Devices","Computation theory; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Learning systems; Embodied cognition theories; Embodied learning; Face to face; Learning in motion; Learning Theory; Math game; Motor schemas; Physical objects; Teaching standard; Theories of learning; Students","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200250274"

This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes.

This research is based on the nationally representative data of 25,206 students surveyed in the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). The HSLS:09 includes longitudinal data from 9th-grade students through their postsecondary study. First, we use machine learning to predict who is going to opt for a STEM major. Then we use interpretable ML tools, such as SHAP values, to investigate the key factors that influence students' decisions to pursue a college STEM major. We identified with a relatively high degree of accuracy the students who will later choose a STEM major, namely our CatBoost classifier achieved an AUC score of 0.791. Moreover, by interpreting the model, we find that having a science or math identity, as well as demographic characteristics, such as gender and race, play important roles in the decision to pursue a STEM major. For example, Asians are more, females are less likely to consider a STEM major, on the other hand, we also find that gender and race do not influence students' science or math identity. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification.

Hence, the 2020 proposal of the Ofqual algorithm which combines teachers' estimated grades and schools' historical performance seemed timely. However, the algorithmically calculated grades resulted in a public backlash and withdrawal of the proposal. While the failed Ofqual algorithm could be considered an example of AI, we do not yet have a thorough understanding of its numerical accuracy and how it performs in comparison to other AI models. This paper investigates this novel application: the potential use of a range of AI models as assessment tools in a selective, independent, secondary school in England. The following questions were examined: (1) how accurate are modern AI models in predicting GCSE exam grades? (2) what are the differences in model accuracy across subjects and can these be explained by qualitative differences in teachers' grading practices? Results indicate that while models yield acceptable mean absolute errors, individual mispredictions can be larger than desired. Subject differences highlighted that grading subjectivity is less significant in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects, which could explain why objective models fail to predict non-STEM grades more frequently. In summary, numerical results indicate that grade prediction could be an interesting novel application of AI, but more research is needed to reduce outliers. © 2023 The Author(s)","Examinations; Grade prediction; Grading; Machine learning","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147343765"

Different education standards consider “Collaboration” as a required and necessary skill that can help students excel in these fields. Instruction-based methods is the most common approach, adopted by teachers to instill collaborative skills. However, it is difficult for a single teacher to observe multiple student groups and provide constructive feedback to each student. With growing student population and limited teaching staff, this problem seems unlikely to go away. Development of machine-learning-based automated systems for student group collaboration assessment and feedback can help address this problem. Building upon our previous work, in this paper, we propose simple CNN deep-learning models that take in spatio-temporal representations of individual student roles and behavior annotations as input for group collaboration assessment. The trained classification models are further used to develop an automated recommendation system to provide individual-level or group-level feedback.

According to the results of the ECE 2019, it is observed that the academic performance achieved in the area of mathematics presents the highest percentage of students at the Satisfactory level (17.7%); however, in turn, said field of study is also the one that groups the highest percentage of students at the Before beginning level (33.0%). Considering the aforementioned, this research aims to identify those variables that affect the learning achievements in mathematics of high school students. Thus, for the proposed analysis, a classification model was built for each of the mentioned levels, through an ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses the gradient boosting method. As a result of the modeling, the importance of the variables analyzed was obtained, which finally identified those that have greater relevance in the prediction of the classification of each level of learning achievement. © 2021 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

There is a limited amount of time an academic advisor may allocate to each student to identify problem areas in the curriculum and take appropriate actions and advise the student based on informed judgement. Thus, there is a need to predict which students are at risk early on in the program. In this work, we have built a prediction model based on particle swarm optimization to estimate the final graduation grade point average (GPA) of students enrolled in the information technology program at Ajman University. Input predictors used in this work were Students' final GPA scores in core courses and high school average grade. Based on records of 74 students who have graduated from the program so far, we have found that the most influential predictor of graduation GPA is high school grade average. Our results showed that the Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics have no role to play in the prediction of GPA while networking and security courses have the most significant prediction contribution. Forty per cent of predicted values fall within 0.25 of the real GPA, which has a maximum upper bound of four. However, the accuracy of the model significantly improved when applied to a much larger publicly available dataset with 88% of GPA scores falling within 0.25 of the actual GPA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computing education; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization; Student performance prediction","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113568423"

'Summer Learning Loss' is the phenomenon where children experience a decrease in academic knowledge and skills when they take an extended break from education, particularly during the summer holidays. Children from lower socio-economic status backgrounds are disproportionately affected by summer learning loss. This research investigates the efficacy of a novel STEM Summer Family Learning Programme for 4-6-year-old children in a socio-economically disadvantaged community. The novelty of our programme centres around the practice and pedagogy delivered in the child's home with parental engagement at its core. The programme is delivered once a week over six weeks by Home Visitors. Child-directed open-ended play-based STEM activities are modelled to encourage children to develop higher-order thinking skills. Parents and children are encouraged to explore these educational STEM Play and Learn activities further between visits. Through a community action research methodology, this research employs a cyclical process of observing, reflecting, acting, evaluating, and modifying. Results of parent and child evaluation data show promise in improving the children's developmental skills and positively influencing the home learning environment. Results also indicate there was an increase in the parents' confidence in teaching their children STEM at home. The findings contribute insights into how an innovative STEM family learning programme for early years educators and parents enhances educational outcomes for kindergarten-aged children and mitigates summer learning loss. © 2024 IEEE.","Diversity and Broadening Participation; Informal Learning Environments; K-12 Education; Pedagogical and Instructional Approaches; STEM","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Broadening participation; Diversity and broadening participation; Engineering and mathematics; Informal learning environments; K-12 education; Learn+; Learning projects; Pedagogical and instructional approach; Science technologies; Science, technology, engineering and mathematic; Contrastive Learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000680377"

We developed Feature City to facilitate students' learning of AI concepts. This study aimed to explore students' learning outcomes and behaviors when using Feature City. Design/methodology/approach: Junior high school students were the subjects who used Feature City in an AI learning activity. The learning activity consisted of 90-min sessions once per week for five weeks. Before the learning activity, the teacher clarified the learning objectives and administered a pretest. The teacher then instructed the students on the features, supervised learning and unsupervised learning units. After the learning activity, the teacher conducted a posttest. We analyzed the students' prior knowledge and learning performance by evaluating their pretest and posttest results and observing their learning behaviors in the AI learning activity. Findings: (1) Students used Feature City to learn AI concepts to improve their learning outcomes. (2) Female students learned more effectively with Feature City than male students. (3) Male students were more likely than female students to complete the learning tasks in Feature City the first time they used it. Originality/value: Within SDGs, this study used STEM and extended reality technologies to develop Feature City to engage students in learning about AI. The study examined how much Feature City improved students' learning outcomes and explored the differences in their learning outcomes and behaviors. The results showed that students' use of Feature City helped to improve their learning outcomes. Female students achieved better learning outcomes than their male counterparts. Male students initially exhibited a behavioral pattern of seeking clarification and error analysis when learning AI education, more so than their female counterparts. The findings can help teachers adjust AI education appropriately to match the tutorial content with students' AI learning needs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence education; Extended reality; SDGs; STEM","","Emerald Publishing","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188280230"

This study aims to examine the relationship between students’ demographic characteristics and their academic achievement at the pre-diploma level using machine learning. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data analysis was used in this study, which involved collecting information about 1,052 pre-diploma students enrolled at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang Branch between 2017 and 2021. The research procedure was divided into two parts: data collecting and pre-processing, and building the machine learning algorithm, pre-training and testing. Findings: Gender, family income, region and achievement in the national secondary school examination (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia [SPM]) predict academic performance. Female students were 1.2 times more likely to succeed academically. Central region students performed better with a value of 1.26. M40-income students were more likely to excel with an odds ratio of 2.809. Students who excelled in SPM English and Mathematics had a better likelihood of succeeding in higher education. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited to pre-diploma students from UiTM Pahang Branch. For better generalizability of the results, future research should include pre-diploma students from other UiTM branches that offer this programme. Practical implications: This study is expected to offer insights for policymakers, particularly, the Ministry of Higher Education, in developing a comprehensive policy to improve the tertiary education system by focusing on the fourth Sustainable Development Goal. Social implications: These pre-diploma students were found to originate mainly from low- or middle-income families; hence, the programme may help them acquire better jobs and improve their standard of living. Most students enrolling on the pre-diploma performed below excellent at the secondary school level and were therefore given the opportunity to continue studying at a higher level. Originality/value: This predictive model contributes to guidelines on the minimum requirements for pre-diploma students to gain admission into higher education institutions by ensuring the efficient distribution of resources and equal access to higher education among all communities. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Demographic; Higher education; Machine learning; Pre-diploma; Student performance","Education computing; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Population statistics; Academic performance; Demographic; High educations; Higher education institutions; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Malaysia; Pre-diploma; Secondary schools; Student performance; Students","Emerald Publishing","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200331404"

It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9-12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.  © 2020 IEEE.","Computer science (CS) unplugged (CS Unplugged); education; entanglement; high-school-aged youth; measurement; qiskit; quantum computing; quantum computing games; quantum gates; quantum teleportation; qubit systems; superposition; teachers; training; workforce development","Bioinformatics; Computer games; Education computing; Engineering education; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Students; Computer science  unplugged (computer science unplugged); Entanglement; High-school-aged youth; Higher School; Qiskit; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing game; Quantum teleportation; Qubit system; Superposition; Teachers'; Workforce development; Personnel training","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122558022"

STEM students in schools and in higher educational institutions appear to be waning, as evidenced by low secondary school STEM enrolments. To add to this, there are also STEM stream students who dropped out and switched to non-STEM streams. This resulted in a shortage of qualified candidates for STEM-based higher education programmes, and subsequently an insufficient number of STEM graduates. Researchers have found several potential contributing factors that may have impacted students’ selection of STEM. However, this relationship is still unclear and needs further investigation. This goal of this systematic review is to assess the factors that can be used to predict students’ selection of a STEM major using existing techniques. To do this, PRISMA's Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process was used to map the findings of previous studies based on the designed research questions (RQs). More specifically, the objective of this analysis was to compile, summarise, and assess related works in order to identify current contributing variables, potential techniques, dataset characteristics, challenges, and future directions within the scope of this investigation. Papers published in major online scientific databases, including Science Direct, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, ProQuest, and Springer, between 2011 and April 2021 were identified and analyzed. Although there were 1248 publications found through extensive SLR selection processes using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 121 articles were selected. After being analyzed, only 16 articles were found to have discussed about machine learning (ML) techniques and showed that the most accurate predictions were possible based on different variables or factors. In addition, the dataset characteristics were found to have impacted the accuracy of the prediction results. However, the available evidences were limited, and the output findings from each study reviewed were relatively diverse. Therefore, evidences discussing the potential usefulness of ML techniques to analyse the relationship between contributing factors should be strengthened. © 2023 The Authors","Machine learning prediction; STEM stream; Systematic literature review","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164347202"

Educating students about the conscious use of AI and its challenges is essential. Still, even before that, it is necessary to educate teachers who need to acquire the necessary skills to use these technologies in the classroom to enrich their students' learning experience. Training must be theoretical and guide teachers in designing educational activities with AI, about AI, and preparing for AI. This article presents research conducted in Italy to understand educators' attitudes toward AI in Education. Responses to a nationwide questionnaire are analysed to understand the relationship between teachers at all levels of schooling and AI. The results show that teachers need more confidence in their AI skills but are also not too concerned about the increasing spread of AI at various levels. From the findings, we can also say that AI has found little space in the school activities of Italian teachers. At the same time, teachers state that they urgently need to be trained on AI issues.

It is established that to implement individualised learning, the goal and objectives of individualisation, the choice of AI services and platforms, opportunities for students, security measures, learning pace, level of mastery of the material and personal interests should be considered. The author proposes a classification of tasks for students using AI and provides examples of assessments for students of grades 7–9 in English, mathematics, and biology. Emphasis is given to the fact that AI-powered automatic assessment enables the recognition of the requirements of every individual student and adapts learning tasks according to their current abilities and knowledge. Despite the challenges and problems of integrating AI into the school environment, the study points to the growing interest of teachers in this technology, the improvement of AI capabilities, and its gradual development as a teacher’s assistant. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","AI; Secondary School; ICT in Education; Individualization of Education; Media Pedagogy; Students; Teacher Development","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence;; ICT in education; Individualisation; Individualization of education; Individualized learning; Medium pedagogy; S-tools; Secondary schools; Teacher development; Teachers'; Students","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199626084"

In the previous studies, high school grades were used as a valid predictor of student success. The quality of a high school's learning environment has an effect on almost every aspect of higher education success. Students who are better prepared coming out of high school are ideally suited to do well in higher education institutions, who they are, how much money they have, and where they go don't matter. This review aims to identify effective features that warrant student success from high school grades and choice of academic courses during registration in higher education. The following questions are used to guide this review: How can we define student success? Which features should we focus on? Which models work? Based on data mining techniques such as machine learning models that the previous studies have used to predict student success, it has been revealed that the most important features that influence student success in a Computer Science programme are Prior Computer experience, Mathematics, English from High school and the choice of a course. © 2021 IEEE.","Higher Education; Machine Learning; Prediction; Student success","Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Education computing; Internet of things; Academic course; Computer experience; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Important features; Learning environments; Machine learning models; Student persistences; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106724201"

Low-achievement is a phenomenon whereby a student, despite completing his or her education, does not reach the level of competence expected by the school system. We train three machine learning models on a large, real dataset through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests and compare the results in terms of predictive and descriptive performance. We exploit data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low-achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The failure rate in secondary education within the discipline of mathematics is significant. Therefore, predicting the performance of students is relevant to support the decision plan on interventions. A dataset with 395 records collected from two secondary schools in Portugal was used in this work. The authors tested eight machine learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Consequently, this work supports future research activities to use NB to predict students' performance. Moreover, this work has ranked the impact of the variables which most disturb students from achieving success. The results recommend the NB algorithm using the top five important features which report 75.22%, 74.41%, 75.22%, and 73,29% of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively.

An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: “Build an AI to compete live in Ghana’s National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition”. The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","BERT; Educational Question Answering; NLP; Science Education; Virtual Teaching Assistant","E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Real time systems; Students; BERT; Educational question answering; Grand Challenge; Learning outcome; Learning support; Question Answering; Real-world; Science education; Teachers'; Virtual teaching assistants; Learning systems","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200210518"

However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or “Learning by Doing”, hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world.

To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","CatBoost; Double particle swarm optimization; Educational data mining; Educational management","Decision making; Education computing; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Students; Catboost; Double particle swarm optimization; Educational data mining; Educational management; Particle swarm; Performance; School students; Secondary schools; Student performance; Swarm optimization; Data mining","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163036424"

The STEM education provides courses to educate students in four disciplines, i.e. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, transforming current industry to a modern industry needs the support from a group of professional people who are familiar with the core technologies of ID 4.0, such as virtual and real Integration systems, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence(AI). Programming is the key to make the above industrial revolution success. Thus, our previous project developed a low cost humanoid robot as a learning tool applied in STEM programs. With the assistance of the humanoid robot, young students can learn programming courses easily and efficiently. Currently, STEM education is often applied in elementary, junior-high and senior-high schools. It really improves students' learning circumstance in STEM fields. This paper introduced the STEAM education model to create a good learning circumstance for art students. Digital teaching aids, such as humanoid robot, and quadruped mechanical animal, support students to learn STEM programs more intuitively. Those aids can help students to learn mechanical mechanisms, electronic motors, digital control and programming and so on. These teaching aids are all open source, and they can be printed by 3D printers. Students can learn mechanics, electronics, and programming via the course. In order to enable students to use the humanoid robot digital teaching aids more effectively and completely, a humanoid robot motion editor is developed. This editor was developed by python and VTK, and it also has a friendly window-based interface. Its main task is to provide students to edit the motion of the robots quickly and easily. Through this editor, students can learn more about multi-foot and humanoid robot motions.  © 2022 IEEE.","Humanid Robot; Python; Qt; STEM; VTK","3D printers; Anthropomorphic robots; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; High level languages; Internet of things; Learning systems; Open source software; Robot programming; Students; Teaching; Digital teachings; Humanid robot; Humanoid robot; Learn+; Qt; STEM; STEM education; STEM program; Teaching aids; VTK; Python","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146427176"

With the rapid growth of data and its impact on daily life, there's a need for new educational methods to help students understand and use data effectively. Data science involves math, statistics, computation, AI, and machine learning, but teaching these concepts can be challenging without access to computers or the internet, potentially widening educational inequities. Inspired by unplugged computer science education, this study supports data science education in unplugged classrooms. Initial research focused on creating and testing two learning units on data visualization and summarization using innovative activities and reflection prompts. Analyzing students' work from a pilot with ten eleventh-graders in a low-income public school in a Global South country, the study aims to understand how these activities support data visualization skills and identify limitations. Future work will develop and implement lesson plans to promote data and AI literacy, aiming to make data science education more inclusive across diverse backgrounds. © 2024 IEEE.","data science education; k-12 education","Data consistency; Daily lives; Data gap; Data science education; Design-based research; Innovative practices; K-12 education; Rapid growth; Research studies; Science education; Science literacy; Data Science","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000651107"

While they have been introduced in various educational contexts, from nursing to mathematics, and for different age groups, including K-12 and university students, little research has been conducted on the benefits of escape rooms for adult learning of artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, most escape room implementations lack relevance to real-world situations and challenges with using AI systems in the wild. This study explores the effectiveness of an escape room, DRONEscape, as a tool for teaching AI concepts to Air Force participants. The results suggest that escape rooms can most effectively facilitate engagement and collaboration, and have positive effects on learning AI concepts.

On average, as nearly half of them face socio-economic disadvantages, a persistent performance disparity was observed compared to domestic students. Remarkably, even after mitigating the influence of socioeconomic status, immigrant students' scores remained inferior. From March to May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project investigated how an AI-based learning assistant can compensate for existing impediments by enabling a better understanding through video-based learning. For this study, 275 students were selected from two secondary schools (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The experiment tested the extent to which learners solve more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and retain it. Students were repeatedly tested on mathematical problems, where the control group did not have access to the AI assistant. In contrast, the other group used the AI assistant to solve the problems. The students' performances from both school groups were statistically tested using t-tests. Within the test group of grammar schools, a significant change in the results between the two test days existed (T(41)=-2,28; pc.01) when the AI tool was used. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change T(37)=-.42; p>.05; d=.O7) in performance. However, the results were insignificant for the secondary school students, as the given tasks and video content were considered too demanding. Further research is needed to determine AIEDN's performance for other target groups. © 2024 IEEE.","AI; AI education; AI learning assistant; migrant students; migration; self-learning; video-based learning","Artificial intelligence; AI education; AI learning assistant; Grammar schools; Learning assistant; Migrant student; Migration; Performance; Secondary schools; Self-learning; Video-based learning; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201188391"

Apart from setting English as a compulsory course like Chinese and Mathematics in schools, various English training institutions outside the school are also emerging one after another. Due to the English teaching mode in class, dumb English appears. In recent years, with the popularity of virtual electronic devices, more and more researchers try to use virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive English learning environment. Oral English teaching is an important part of the whole English teaching. In the traditional English classroom teaching practice, teachers' pronunciation is not standard, and students are difficult to learn the correct pronunciation standard, which makes oral English very passive. The most important problem in oral English teaching is to improve students' interest in oral English, make students willing to speak and realize English communication. Oral English teaching is an important link in both primary and secondary schools and universities. Teachers are afraid of nonstandard pronunciation in limited classrooms, and they are afraid to speak and unwilling to speak, which leads to passive oral English teaching. Therefore, this paper will set up an intelligent computing model to evaluate and analyze spoken English in a standard and accurate way. Artificial intelligence speech synthesis and imitation of voice change are typical applications of decoupling representation learning in speech, the oral evaluation is based on the proposition that speech is a dynamic and complex process. With the help of the rapidly developed computer speech synthesis and imitation technology, an oral evaluation path based on speech synthesis and imitation is proposed, that is, oral evaluation is carried out by using the network parameters and output of deep learning of computer speech imitation.  © 2022 Caihong Jing et al.","","Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Computing model; Electronics devices; English teaching; Immersive; Key topics; Oral english; Oral English teachings; Teachers'; Teaching modes; Training institutions; Speech synthesis","Hindawi Limited","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132504007"

Many methods are pursued to help this group of pupils, such as psychological, a proper schedule for the vulnerable pupil, recall, personal training, mock-tests, private education by direct studies, or the success centers. However, these approaches are not enough to deal with the dilemma, since other variables are impacting the success of the learner, which may be their family problems, their cognitive style, Their previous academic accomplishment, the cornerstone of the college level. This paper explores the effect of pre-college academic accomplishments on the success of college students in the computer program. The pilot study predicts student academic success based on their math (EmSAT Math), English (EmSAT English), and High School Average (High School Average) knowledge and skills acquired by students before college entry. The study covers 120 students. After cleaning up the available data, we are left with 112 instances used to train machine learning models to predict learner performance in the computer program. The qualified models achieved a high precision of 90.5 percent (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest), while the Logistic Regression achieved a forecast accuracy of 78.1 percent. The main symptom for the student's academic status was the score in English, followed by the score in Math. The research has shown that the high school score is not the secret to predicting students with academic status at their college stage. © 2020 IEEE.","Academic success; At-risk students; Learners' cognitive; Learning differences; Machine learning for academic predication; Per-admission evaluation; Students' retention","Decision trees; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Cognitive styles; College students; Educational organizations; Forecast accuracy; High-precision; Machine learning models; Personal trainings; Private educations; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100604629"

Unfortunately, below 50% of the students who enter the STEM fields graduate with a STEM-related degree. Hence, the USA must continue to be innovative and take creative steps to compete as a world power and leader in STEM fields. If innovation and creative STEM outreach efforts shift focus from working professionals and begin targeting traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM at the secondary education level, this would increase the technical talent pool. This study examines the attitudes of students toward STEM with a near-peer mentor model and without a near-peer mentor (NPM) in a virtual STEM research-based designed experience. The pilot quantitative study design fostered a supportive, structured virtual environment in which students can gain confidence in their abilities to master STEM subjects and become motivated to strive from internally driven values to achieve. The study's results reveal how student participants experienced near-peer mentoring and non-near-peer mentoring.

Informed by a recently-developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students’ academic preparedness and use administrative data from the New York City Department of Education to measure differences in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics.

It outlines a model using basic math and probability to assess and mitigate risks to these cyber assets, which include data, vulnerability, and potential negative impacts like financial or reputational loss at the time of cyber incident. The approach equates cyber assets to financial terms-assets, liabilities, and capital-to demonstrate how additional countermeasures can reduce cyber asset value. The paper emphasizes the importance of consistent cybersecurity practices, akin to the effects of compound interest, and aims to demystify cybersecurity for students using financial literacy and mathematical concepts. The paper uses the proposed method to calculate cyber risks for the prominent cyber-attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Data breach, Ransom ware, and loT Vulnerabilities in the context of school. It further explains the value of problem based learning and provides an authentic assessment framework to establish a practical learning of cybersecurity concepts for high school students. Finally, it advocates for the integration of security measures in internet use, covering authentication, authorization, encryption, firewall, secure connections, and systems' upgrade to reduce cyber risks. With the rise of online education, gaming, social media, and digitalization, cyber awareness is crucial for high school students. The criticality of internet security is making cyber knowledge an urgent educational priority. Due to growing demand of loT and artificial intelligence (AI), the paper suggests future research about explaining cyber risks to high school students using machine learning, human behavior, and system anomalies. © 2024 IEEE.","Authentic Assessment; Cyber Threats; Cyber Value at Risk (CVaR); Cybersecurity; Financial literacy; Probability","Adversarial machine learning; Anonymity; Authentication; Cyber attacks; Risk assessment; Students; Authentic assessment; Cybe value at risk; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-security educations; Financial literacy; High school students; Higher School; Value at Risk; Phishing","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000706415"

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between high school students’ performance in Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) Placement, Preparation, and Learning (PPL) Modules and performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. The participants in this study were 100 students from five high schools in the United States. Each student was placed into one of two groups: the ALEKS Group, who completed the ALEKS Pre-Calculus Learning Modules, and the Non-ALEKS Group, who did not complete the modules. Students’ scores were compared statistically to test for significant differences. The analysis included a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to measure how assignment of the modules affected exam scores. A logistic regression was used to assess differences between the two groups in placing into college algebra. A statistically significant difference was found in exam scores between the ALEKS Group and the Non-ALEKS Group which indicated that assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Learning Modules did increase performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. Conversely, assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Modules did not increase students’ likelihood of placing into College Algebra. The amount of time students spent taking the exam influenced student outcomes on the ALEKS Mathematics Placement exam. These results show that schools could implement Intelligent Tutoring Systems into their current mathematics classrooms to help students increase their scores on college entry mathematics placement exams. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","artificial intelligence; college mathematics preparation; intelligent tutoring systems; quantitative literacy education","","International Association for Computer Information Systems","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174258672"

As online learning becomes increasingly popular, analyzing how students engage with video content provides important insights into their learning behaviors. This study explores multiple factors influencing K-12 students' in-video dropout rates in online math education. We examined 34,666,481 log entries from Math Nation, covering 1313 videos and 14,251 students. Using survival analysis, we evaluated how 27 variables, including demographic details, video interaction behaviors, and video characteristics(e.g. length, category), affect in-video dropout. Our findings reveal that video length significantly predicts dropout, with each additional minute increasing the dropout rate by 1.26%. Videos with higher dropout rates often feature more frequent pauses, jumps, and rewatches. The study also highlights that the quality of video content, the creators of the videos, and how students interact with the videos are crucial factors affecting dropout rates. Further research is needed to determine the specific causes of video dropout. © 2024 IEEE.","in-video dropout; survival analysis; video learning","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Students; Video recording; In-progress research; In-video dropout; Learning behavior; Learning platform; Multiple factors; Online learning; Research papers; Survival analysis; Video contents; Video learning; Video analysis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000805629"

Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6th to 9th grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners’ ability and the stream. As a result, for learners’ ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners’ stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods. Furthermore, it provides a tool to ease students academic path selection, which may be used by educational institutes to ensure student performance.

A group of 53 middle school students was invited to our campus to learn about computer science and tour the campus. These students attended a local public school and were involved in a robotics club at their school. This paper describes our workshops at CS Day, which aimed to provide students with a better understanding of computer science and its related fields. The CS Day provided students with the opportunity to learn about computer science as a career and computer science concepts. Several lectures and activities were created to provide a fulfilling and interactive day of learning for the students. Touring our campus and interacting with college students exposed middle school students to the idea of pursuing a college degree in computer science. The students learned about careers in computer science, basic computer programming concepts, the concept of binary and how it relates to computer hardware, artificial intelligence, game design and development, and the concept of blockchain. We presented learning activities that were interactive and hands-on, allowing the students to learn by doing. By the end of the CS Day, each student had gained valuable insights into the world of computer science and its applications, which can help them make more informed decisions about future career plans. We provided pre-and post-tests for two of our workshops to assess if our workshops helped students increase their understanding of computer science concepts. The pre-and post-surveys asked questions about translating binary and performing basic math with it. Additionally, the survey asked basic questions about computers and their binary relation. During the lecture, the students were given papers to help them follow and learn from the lecture, and a binary game to test their knowledge after the lecture. Our studies show that the student scores improved by 100% or more in both workshops between the pre-and postworkshop assessments. The assessment questions were the same in the pre-and post-tests to ensure consistency. Our assessment results show that our CS Day was very successful, and it is hoped that enriched computing programs like this will encourage more young students to pursue careers in computer science and help address the growing demand for skilled professionals in the computing industry. We present this paper to share the interactive learning activities we designed, the results of pre-and post-tests we conducted with the students, and future work in the area of outreach to secondary school-aged students in the field of computer science. © 2023 IEEE.","Blockchain; CS Success; Game Development; Machine Learning","Blockchain; Computer games; Computer hardware; Engineering education; Machine learning; Robot programming; Software design; Block-chain; Computer science success; Computing programmes; Game development; Learn+; Learning Activity; Machine-learning; Middle school students; Post test; Public schools; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183019781"

In this study, the power of various machine learning techniques to learn the complicated task of predicting students’ performance in math courses using demographic data of 395 students was investigated. Predicting students’ performance through demographic information makes it possible to predict their performance before the start of the course. Filtered and wrapper feature selection methods were used to find 10 important features in predicting students’ final math grades. Then, all the features of the data set as well as the 10 selected features of each of the feature selection methods were used as input for the regression analysis with the Adaboost model. Finally, the prediction performance of each of these feature sets in predicting students’ math grades was evaluated using criteria such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient and mean squared error. The best result was obtained from feature selection by the LASSO method. After the LASSO method for feature selection, the Extra Tree and Gradient Boosting Machine methods respectively had the best prediction of the final math grade. The present study showed that the LASSO feature selection technique integrated with regression analysis with the Adaboost model is a suitable data mining framework for predicting students’ mathematical performance. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fair AI; learning analytics; machine learning; online learning","","Routledge","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136886559"

The performance of students was analyzed and measured as a binomial response whether students successfully finished the first and the second study years. The developed model examined general success, number of awards obtained at competitions, special awards, average grades in mathematics, physics, and one of the official state languages during secondary school as predictor variables. The number of courses transferred from the first into the second study year and students’ GPA obtained during the first study year were added as predictor variables in the analysis and development of a prediction model for the students’ performance during the second study year and their enrollment in the third study year. Developed machine learning prediction model showed that for the performance of enrolled students in the first study year general success of students during secondary school is the most important predictor variable, followed by mathematics and physics grades.

This digital course has been developed to address the varying levels of understanding of fundamental mathematics among first-year engineering students, who often have disparate levels of prior knowledge at their high school completion. We observe an increasing need to bridge the widening gap between high school and university mathematics in order to prevent engineering students from being hindered in their academic successes due to a lack of prior mathematical understanding. With a team of engineers and mathematicians, both researchers and educators, we are developing a mathematics Bridging Course including the use of digital tools, such as videos, online interactions and technology-based assessments. These sources were created, investigated and/or modified to develop an engaging learning environment in which students are made aware of and guided through misconceptions and mistakes in their understanding of fundamental mathematics. In the development of this Bridging Course, we consider the importance of interactive learning and timely feedback for student learning. We investigate the impact of digital course design on students' performance and learning outcomes using a qualitative approach. Students feedback within the first stage of the implementation of the course offered a positive assessment of the course, accentuating its inherent advantages and attributes. The students' feedback proved to be an invaluable source of insights, specifically concerning the enhancement of question distractors, thus prompting revisions and augmentations in the assessment items employed. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students’ needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students’ individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students’ science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both – meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students’ learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students’ learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students’ learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students’ learning – the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.

The purpose of this preliminary study is to increase African American and Hispanic students with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and persistence in CS and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers. This project employs a project-based voice user interface (VUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) instruction, and tech mentoring. Of the 21 teachers participating in the Alliance, the research team identified a convenience sample of eight teachers to participate in semi-structured, focus group interviews. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, the researchers identified the following emergent themes: limitations of school or administrative policies for African American and Hispanic SWD enrolling in CS classes, lack of CS-focused interventions for African American and Hispanic SWD, lack of formal teacher preparation for CS teachers to work with SWD, and structural barriers limiting SWD, Hispanic, and Black students' enrollment in CS classes.

However, existing benchmarks either require just a few steps of reasoning, or only contain a small amount of data in one specific topic, making it hard to analyse AI's behaviour with reference to different problems within a specific topic in detail. In this work, we propose CONIC10K, a challenging math problem dataset on conic sections in Chinese senior high school education. Our dataset contains various problems with different reasoning depths, while only the knowledge from conic sections is required. Since the dataset only involves a narrow range of knowledge, it is easy to separately analyse the knowledge a model possesses and the reasoning ability it has. For each problem, we provide a high-quality formal representation, the reasoning steps, and the final solution. Experiments show that existing large language models, including GPT-4, exhibit weak performance on complex reasoning. We hope that our findings could inspire more advanced techniques for precise natural language understanding and reasoning.

Through our established partnerships with schools in California and Kansas, we have developed educational tools to positively influence the learning and career paths of young high school (HS) students from underserved districts and underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Through the development of new curricula, teaching modules, and shared resources that are made broadly available to other school districts, this work has the potential to impact a large number of K-12 teachers and students. We have been working to train HS teachers to create connections between the STEM subjects they teach students with advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that are often taught only post-HS. It creates a context where students can see how their STEM skills can be applied and a pathway of continuing STEM education from secondary to post-secondary. As a result, there is the potential to improve student interest and self-efficacy in STEM and to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Furthermore, AI is key to understanding and making use of data and solving many control problems. We aim to help students learn the fundamentals of how AI algorithms are applied in contemporary neuroscience. © 2022 The Authors.","artificial intelligence; biomedical control systems; Control education; databases; machine learning; medical applications; stochastic control","Curricula; Engineering education; Machine learning; Medical applications; Professional aspects; Stem cells; Stochastic systems; Biomedical control; Biomedical control system; Controls education; Engineering and mathematics; High school students; Machine-learning; Science education; Science technologies; Stochastic control; Technology education; Students","Elsevier B.V.","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142231082"

However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme ""Mathematics and AI"" which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

This study developed predictive models for the academic success of autistic bachelor students (N = 101) in comparison to students with other health conditions (N = 2465) and students with no health conditions (N = 25,077). We applied propensity score weighting to balance outcomes. The research showed that autistic students’ academic success was predictable, and these predictions were more accurate than predictions of their peers’ success. For first-year success, study choice issues were the most important predictors (parallel program and application timing). Issues with participation in pre-education (missingness of grades in pre-educational records) and delays at the beginning of autistic students’ studies (reflected in age) were the most influential predictors for the second-year success and delays in the second and final year of their bachelor’s program. In addition, academic performance (average grades) was the strongest predictor for degree completion in 3 years. These insights can enable universities to develop tailored support for autistic students. Using early warning signals from administrative data, institutions can lower dropout risk and increase degree completion for autistic students. Laymen Summary: What is already known about the topic? Autistic youths increasingly enter universities. We know from existing research that autistic students are at risk of dropping out or studying delays. Using machine learning and historical information of students, researchers can predict the academic success of bachelor students. However, we know little about what kind of information can predict whether autistic students will succeed in their studies and how accurate these predictions will be. What does this article add? In this research, we developed predictive models for the academic success of 101 autistic bachelor students. We compared these models to 2,465 students with other health conditions and 25,077 students without health conditions. The research showed that the academic success of autistic students was predictable. Moreover, these predictions were more precise than predictions of the success of students without autism. For the success of the first bachelor year, concerns with aptitude and study choice were the most important predictors. Participation in pre-education and delays at the beginning of autistic students’ studies were the most influential predictors for second-year success and delays in the second and final year of their bachelor’s program. In addition, academic performance in high school was the strongest predictor for degree completion in 3 years. Implications for practice, research, or policy These insights can enable universities to develop tailored support for autistic students. Using early warning signals from administrative data, institutions can lower dropout risk and increase degree completion for autistic students. © The Author(s) 2023.","academic achievement; autism; higher education; predictive modeling; propensity score weighting; student retention","Academic Success; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Educational Measurement; Humans; Students; academic achievement; academic success; adult; aptitude; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; chronic disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; dyslexia; educational status; engineering; female; hearing impairment; human; language disability; learning algorithm; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mathematics; outcome assessment; physical disability; prediction; predictive model; prevalence; procrastination; propensity score; quality control; school dropout; science; secondary education; socioeconomics; student retention; technology; tertiary education; undergraduate education; vocation; adolescent; education; student","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145907958"

This has generated increased demand for fostering an AI-literate populace as well as a growing recognition of the importance of promoting K-12 students' awareness and interest in AI. Although efforts are beginning to incorporate AI learning within K-12 education, there is little research exploring how to introduce students to AI and how to support teachers to integrate AI learning experiences in their classrooms. This is especially true at the elementary school level. A particularly promising approach for providing effective and engaging AI learning experiences for elementary students is game-based learning. In this paper, we explore how to introduce AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning into upper elementary school (student ages 8 to 11) using game-based learning. To ground the work in the realities of elementary school classrooms, we present insights from interviews with elementary school teachers to understand how best to support them in integrating AI into their classrooms. We then present the design of PRIMARYAI, a game-based learning environment that supports rich problem-based learning activities within upper elementary classrooms centered on AI applied toward solving life-science problems. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning to upper elementary students.

The results indicate that students’ mental models of the machine learning system changes during the workshop and that students initially hold a variety of conceptions that can be structured along two facets (“internal model” and “learning process”). Some of these conceptions are useful for learning, while others may present an obstacle - an information that is relevant for designing teaching about machine learning in the context of general education. © 2023 The Authors","Computer science education; Conceptions of machine learning; K12 education; Phenomenography","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160075965"

As one of the main parts of mathematics teaching, concepts are the core of mathematics knowledge. Moreover, concept assimilation is the essential learning approach for senior students to acquire mathematics concepts. Therefore, this study constructed the Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning. Combining both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, this study first constructed the evaluation system from the theoretical perspective using the Delphi method. Then, the video analysis was used to verify the evaluation system by conducting a qualitative analysis of high-quality teaching videos from the practical perspective with the help of artificial intelligence. Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning constructed in this study included four first-level indicators: teacher-student interaction in the concept recognition stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept processing stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept reinforcement stage, and teacher-student interaction in the concept application stage, and eight second-level indicators: mutual communication, mobilizing learning initiative, explanation and exploration, inspired focus, example analysis, inspiration and concentration, task solving, and encouragement and feedback. This study could provide quantitative evaluation tools and theoretical models for teacher-student interaction in concept assimilation learning, and enrich teachers' understanding of concept teaching theory and teacher-student interaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","Artificial intelligence; Concept assimilation; Evaluation model; Facial recognition; Qualitative analysis; Speech recognition; Teacher-student interaction","","Springer Nature","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152548248"

This work analyzes whether the ENEM 2019 test presented similar curves for subpopulations defined by gender, race, and income, regardless of the participant’s actual abilities. Our approach is to analyze the properties of the observed curve for each group and then perform a nonparametric ranking test to compare the equity of each item (question) for each analyzed characteristic.

Introductory programming classes can be difficult for learners; especially those without any programming background. Beginners must learn a new way of thinking, made more difficult by issues learning syntax. It's especially hard for students who lack a strong mathematics background. Observations across 3 editions of a CS0 pre-intro-programming course show that students consistently overestimate difficulties, and, come away with a stronger motivation for studying programming in the future as well as considering computer science (CS) and data science (DS) majors, minors, and certificates as options for future study after completion. A wider variety of students consider CS-adjacent college programs, and this can have an appreciable impact on the diversity of the student body entering CS/DS programs. We have found that long term success in CS/DS is predicted by strong motivational factors. While many high school students bring a strong motivation for pursuing CS/DS due to socioeconomic factors (exposure through people they know) and availability of coursework in high school; for other students, some may not have considered CS/DS as an option due to perceived difficulty as well as steep math requirements that function as barriers-to-entry. A CS0 pre-programming course like ours explicitly centers itself as 'coding-is-fun' and encourages creativity. Students engage strongly with and are motivated to put in extra outside-of-class work required for mastery of material. We have limited evidence due to the fact that the data we have is from our small liberal arts college, however, 2 key factors make our observations and analysis valuable: 1) being a Hispanic-Serving-Institution (HSI) and an Asian-American and Native-American Pacific-Islander Serving-Institution (AANAPISI) we have a diverse student body, and 2) we are not a highly selective college which brings in a wide variety of students in terms of prior preparation. Having a CS0 pre-programming' coding-is-fun' allows this diverse student body to 'test-the-waters' and, if interested, to pursue further CS/DS education by reducing the barrier-to-entry. We present data on: student perceptions before/after taking the course; the numbers of students considering further study including the breakdown of course-based vs self-study; and the tremendous numbers of students who find coding easier and therefore something they will use in their future life regardless of whether they formally plan to study CS/DS. The final point is critical in terms of adjusting to life in the 21st century as many fields/professions continue to increasingly be influenced by information and data technologies. © 2024 IEEE.","CS education; CS4all; CSO; Intro Programming","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy balance; Problem oriented languages; Teaching; College students; Computer Science Education; Cs4all; CSO; Innovative practices; Intro programming; Introductory programming; Pre-programming; Programming course; Science-data; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000709032"

In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students' skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered.

With nearly 30 million contestants in 63 provinces and cities across the country, the competition has created the joy of learning for tens of millions of students over the past 10 years. Following the success of Violympic, FPT corporation brought the VioEdu Online Education System to the market, contributing to creating fair learning opportunities for students nationwide, promoting the quality of national education. VioEdu is an online training system for elementary, junior high and high school students, helping to personalize their learning, save time and increase learning efficiency by applying the latest technology such as: Artificial intelligence (AI), Big data analysis, graphical knowledge modeling and compatible learning methods. Accordingly, the training process, data on learning behaviors and knowledge of students will be synthesized and analyzed by AI to find strengths and gaps in knowledge to propose appropriate learning pathways. As a result, each skill, depending on the nature, will be cultivated or promoted separately, helping them to learn the right focus and not spread out. The content of the lessons on VioEdu is developed and developed by a team of excellent teachers and educational experts from education departments and universities, following the curriculum of Vietnamese textbooks. In addition, the system also has about 30% of advanced and expanded knowledge. The form of visual lecture presentation, built as a game with encouraging prizes, creates a learning interest for children. Only with computers or mobile devices connected to the internet, students from all over the country can access modern education, shorten the knowledge gap between regions by the VioEdu online education system.

As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers.  © 2020 ACM.","computer science education; Data science education; high school; interdisciplinary; K12; secondary education","Curricula; Data handling; Engineering education; Equalizers; Machine learning; Teaching; Computer science teachers; Data processing algorithms; Domain knowledge; Interdisciplinary fields; Science curriculum; Science programs; Summer workshops; Undergraduate program; Data Science","Association for Computing Machinery","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123040085"

The challenges and approaches are evidenced in a wide range of literature. Our goal is to develop an active engagement module for introductory quantum mechanics that would cover the most important concepts: indeterminism, incompatibility, the difference between superposition and statistical mixture and the role of measurement. To accomplish this, we developed a free on-line simulation of a double well - a (pseudo) two-state system - which is able to evidence all of the above concepts. Students perform simulated experiments and build their knowledge from their observations. We present the simulation and the proposed experiments to address the above concepts. We provide a description of the activities and their outcomes as tested with high-school students in different settings. Qualitative analysis of learning outcomes offers evidence that between 60% and 100% of students can reach the following conclusions on their own. (i) The particle is only ever detected in one of the possible states. (ii) The outcome of one experiment cannot be predicted, only its probability can be predicted. (iii) For some pairs of quantities, knowing the value of one quantity exactly precludes the possibility of knowing the value of the other quantity exactly. (iv) A statistical mixture (of eigenstates) is not the same as a superposition state. (v) The measurement affects the time evolution of the system. The most difficult conclusion for students to reach is how exactly the measurement affects the system. The success rates presented here lead us to conclude that the simulated experiments can be very useful when designing an active engagement course on the concepts of quantum mechanics. While the development is done in high-school, we believe the results are also relevant for introductory university level, especially for non-physics students. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","active learning; high-school; introductory level; ISLE; quantummechanics; simulation","Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Mechanics; Mixtures; Students; Active Learning; Double well; Higher School; Introductory level; ISLE; Online simulation; Quantummechanic; Simulated experiments; Simulation; Two-state systems; Quantum theory","Institute of Physics","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089215691"

In this counterbalanced randomized controlled trial, 243 tenth and eleventh grade mathematics students were exposed to one of two conditions, as we measured their learning from: 1) immediate feedback (where the computer told them correctness and they could also ask for hints) or 2) practice only (where they received feedback only after taking a posttest). Results suggest that immediate feedback from computer-based learning tasks benefit both high and low prior knowledge students, with low prior knowledge students exhibiting greater gains. The implications of these findings support further investigation into the use of computer-based learning tasks that provide immediate feedback. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computer-based learning; Mathematics education; Prior knowledge; Technology; Urban high school","Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Feedback; Computer-based learning; Educational research; Immediate feedbacks; Matthew effects; Prior knowledge; Randomized controlled trial; Rich get richer; Student performance; Students","Springer","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088587023"

Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synthesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Early years education; Elementary education; Improving classroom teaching; Secondary education; Socially assistive robots","Intelligent robots; User experience; Classroom learning; Classroom settings; Educational robotics; Ethical considerations; Intelligent applications; Learning languages; Socially assistive robots; Tertiary education; Educational robots","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085640755"

Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent sub-fields, the popularity of which is complemented with its high demand as a professional skill for different industries. In the last few years, teaching ML is thus increasingly common in different levels of education. However, the curricula implemented for several courses or programs to learn ML are not always appropriate for the backgrounds of students, particularly high school students, as programming and complex math experience are usually required to implement ML models and understand the potential of this field. For this reason, it is possible for students to have difficulties with the lack of experience required or expected and to have prior to learning ML topics. In addition, motivation can be affected, as the curriculum does not sufficiently engage the student in the learning process. In this work, we propose a visualization tool to introduce high school students to the ML field, which will be implemented using concepts of gamification and adapting the content of the curriculum without requiring exhaustive experience in programming or math.  © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Education; Gamification; Machine Learning; Visualization.","Curricula; Education computing; Industrial research; Machine learning; Visualization; Education tool; High demand; High school; High school students; Learning process; Professional skills; Research topics; Visualization tools; Students","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099049734"

We propose a new method to infer engagement patterns of users in such self-directed environments. We view engagement as a continuous process in time, measured along chosen axes that are derived from student data in the system using unsupervised learning (Principal Component Analysis). We construct a trajectory of user activity by projecting the user's scores along the selected PCs at regular time intervals. This approach is applied to a popular e-learning software for K12 math education that is used by thousands of students worldwide. We identify cohorts of users according to the way their trajectory changes over time (e.g., monotone up, monotone down, and constant). Each of the cohorts exhibits distinct behavioral dynamics and differed substantially in the amount of time users spent in the e-learning system. Specifically, one cohort included students that dropped out of the system after choosing very difficult problems that they were not able to complete, while another cohort included students users that chose more diverse problems and stayed longer in the system. In future work, these results can be used by teachers or intelligent tutors to track students' engagement in the system and decide whether and how to intervene. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Educational technology; prediction methods.; unsupervised learning","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Educational technology; Job analysis; Machine learning; Students; Time series analysis; Trajectories; Unsupervised learning; Behavioral dynamics; Continuous process; E-learning environment; Electronic learning; Prediction methods; Self-directed learning; Supervised learning approaches; Task analysis; Principal component analysis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067817274"

It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first computer language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Computing education - Computational thinking; Computing education programs - Computer science education; Computing literacy; Constructionism; Constructivism; Data types and structures; Education - Interactive learning environments; Functional languages; Functions and subroutines; History of computing - History of programming languages; Imperative languages; Informal education; Interactive computation; K-12 education (ages 5-18); Language features - Control structures; Lisp; Logo; Procedures; Recursion; Recursion; Recursive functions; Software notations and tools - General programming languages; Theory of computation - Models of computation - Computability - Lambda calculus; Turtle geometry","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Recursive functions; Artificial intelligence research; Language development; Learning environments; Mathematics education; Programming environment; Symbolic computation; Teaching and learning; Theoretical framework; LISP (programming language)","Association for Computing Machinery","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091286885"

This was a Class Action Research implemented to 40 students at 7th grade of MTsN Batang Toru. The data collection techniques were carried out by observation and distribution of a questionnaire. The data analysis technique used the analysis of Miles and Huberman models with three stages, namely data reduction, data display, and drawing conclusions. This research used three cycles to obtain the desired results. The results of the observation during the learning process showed the observations of the first cycle in the first meeting, student activity was 34.82%, and that in the second meeting was 42.33%. Furthermore, the students' activeness in the second cycle of the first meeting was 51.5%, and that in the second meeting was 63.83%. The third cycle of the first meeting was 74.16%, at the second meeting was 85.16%. A questionnaire indicated that students' activeness during the first, second and third cycles were 44.16%, 64.16% and 84.33%, respectively. It can be concluded that the activeness of students in the line and angle topics in mathematics lessons using the concrete object demonstration method had increased as expected. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Artificial intelligence; Demonstrations; Education computing; Learning systems; Surveys; Action research; Active Learning; Concrete objects; Data analysis techniques; Data collection; Data display; Junior high schools; Learning process; Students","Institute of Physics Publishing","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085522533"

Machine Learning (ML), as an integral subfield of AI, has become the new engine that revolutionizes practices of knowledge discovery. Making ML experience accessible to young learners, however, remains challenging due to its high demand for mathematical and computational skills. This research focuses on designing novel learning environments that help demystify ML technologies for K-12 students, and also investigating new opportunities for maximizing ML accessibility through integration with scientific discovery in STEM education. We developed SmileyCluster - a hands-on and collaborative learning environment that utilizes glyph-based data visualization and superposition comparative visualization to assist learning an entry-level ML technology, namely k-means clustering. Findings from an initial case study with high school students in a pre-college summer program show that SmileyCluster leads to positive change in learning ML concepts, methods and sense-making of patterns. Findings of this study also shed light on understanding ML as a data-enabled approach to support evidence-based scientific discovery in K-12 STEM education. © 2020 ACM.","AI literacy; data visualization; hands-on learning; scientific discovery; STEM education","Computer aided instruction; Data visualization; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Students; Visualization; Collaborative learning environment; Comparative visualization; Computational skills; High school students; K-12 STEM education; Learning environments; Positive changes; Scientific discovery; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087405579"

We introduce a mobile-friendly, digital support for analog learning experiences called LiveHint, which currently supports students as they work on assignments in Carnegie Learning’s physical worktexts via a chatbot with access to thousands of context-sensitive hints. In addition to expanding the number of courses supported by LiveHint, we discuss possibilities for expanding the scope of activities supported by LiveHint within Carnegie Learning’s existing content. We also lay out possibilities for expanding the approach beyond Carnegie Learning’s content to teacher-created artifacts (e.g., custom worksheets), hand-offs between instructional modalities, and potential research use-cases for data collected from such a platform.

In this study we aim to develop an assessment methodology based on data mining approach. Two data mining techniques &#x2013; cluster analysis and classification and regression trees (CART) are applied to investigate the influence of assessment elements on the final grade in two core mathematical subjects - linear algebra and analytical geometry. In addition, the specialty, academic year of education, and the sex of the students, as well as competency-based test results on content covered by secondary education curriculum are included. Using hierarchical cluster analysis the variables of scale type are classified into two clusters. CART models are built to regress and predict the summative assessment results in dependence of examined variables. The obtained models fit well over 90% of the data. It was established the relative importance of used variables in the model. The obtained results help to measure directly the student achievements and competencies in mathematics. &#x00A9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification and Regression Trees; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Mathematical competencies; Summative assessment","Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Curricula; Education computing; Forestry; Hierarchical systems; Information systems; Information use; Linear algebra; Students; Trees (mathematics); Assessment methodologies; Classification and regression tree; Education curriculums; Educational systems; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Mathematical competencies; Statistical evaluation; Summative assessments; Data mining","Springer Verlag","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065698742"
