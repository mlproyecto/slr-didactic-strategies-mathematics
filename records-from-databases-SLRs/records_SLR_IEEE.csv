"AI-Driven Educational Transformation in Secondary Schools: Leveraging Data Insights for Inclusive Learning Environments","D. Duraes; R. Bezerra; P. Novais","Algoritmi Center/LASI, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal; Algoritmi Center/LASI, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal; Algoritmi Center/LASI, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal",2024 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),"8 Jul 2024","2024","","","1","9","In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a progressive trend towards teaching that is more personalised to students' characteristics and some models of prediction failure that are more accurate. In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students. The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands. Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments. In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578910","FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia(grant numbers:UIDB/00319/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578910","Learning Environments;machine learning techniques;Secondary School","Visualization;Ethics;Art;Education;Machine learning;Predictive models;Mathematics","","","","26","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the abovementioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed “unplugged” activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university.","","978-1-7281-8969-7","10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259970","Quantum computing;education;training;high schoolers;teachers;workforce development;CS-unplugged;qubit systems;quantum gates;measurement;superposition;entanglement;quantum teleportation;Qiskit;quantum computing games","Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Games;Qubit;Conferences;Programming profession;Training","","8","","58","IEEE","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigates the influence of primary and secondary school teachers on students’ STEM engagement within the Spanish education system, with a focus on gender equality. Using a descriptive correlational design, the research gathered responses from 664 teachers, revealing differences in beliefs and practices between primary and secondary educators regarding STEM promotion. The findings indicate that while primary teachers often emphasize career opportunities, secondary teachers focus on explaining STEM study content. Interestingly, only a minority of teachers (30-40%) report receiving gender equality training, underscoring a need for better teacher education in this area. The study also identifies key gender-related barriers, including stereotypes, lack of female role models, and limited STEM career visibility. These barriers are compounded by societal pressures, leading to fewer women in technology-related studies. The results call for education systems to enhance curricula with gender-sensitive practices and align primary and secondary teaching approaches to cultivate technological interest from an early age. Improved STEM training for teachers, as well as activities that promote female role models, can foster a supportive environment for girls. This study contributes to understanding the role of educators in shaping STEM aspirations and highlights the urgent need for systemic changes to address the gender gap in STEM fields.","1932-8540","","10.1109/RITA.2025.3554310","Teaching Innovation Project titled “InGenias: Fomentando vocaciones tecnológicas y la divulgación científica" [InGenias: Promoting Technological Vocations and Scientific Outreach],” funded by the Vice-Rectorate for Teaching Innovation and Digital Transformation at the University of Valladolid.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10938410","Technological vocations;gender gap;teacher education;primary school teachers;secondary school teachers","Training;Europe;Data mining;Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things;Image color analysis;Gender equity;Big Data","","","","63","IEEE","25 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High school students face a significant gap in cybersecurity knowledge, essential for safeguarding the digital environment. This educational deficit renders them vulnerable to cyber threats, compromising personal and school-wide digital security. The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals exacerbates the issue, threatening future defenses against cyberattacks. This paper introduces Cyber Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a concept adapted from finance, to evaluate the risk to digital assets. It outlines a model using basic math and probability to assess and mitigate risks to these cyber assets, which include data, vulnerability, and potential negative impacts like financial or reputational loss at the time of cyber incident. The approach equates cyber assets to financial terms-assets, liabilities, and capital-to demonstrate how additional countermeasures can reduce cyber asset value. The paper emphasizes the importance of consistent cybersecurity practices, akin to the effects of compound interest, and aims to demystify cybersecurity for students using financial literacy and mathematical concepts. The paper uses the proposed method to calculate cyber risks for the prominent cyber-attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Data breach, Ransom ware, and loT Vulnerabilities in the context of school. It further explains the value of problem based learning and provides an authentic assessment framework to establish a practical learning of cybersecurity concepts for high school students. Finally, it advocates for the integration of security measures in internet use, covering authentication, authorization, encryption, firewall, secure connections, and systems' upgrade to reduce cyber risks. With the rise of online education, gaming, social media, and digitalization, cyber awareness is crucial for high school students. The criticality of internet security is making cyber knowledge an urgent educational priority. Due to growing demand of loT and artificial intelligence (AI), the paper suggests future research about explaining cyber risks to high school students using machine learning, human behavior, and system anomalies.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893209","Cybersecurity;Cyber Value at Risk (CVaR);Probability;Financial literacy;Cyber Threats;Authentic Assessment","Education;Finance;Authentication;Machine learning;Data breach;Encryption;Behavioral sciences;Compounds;Computer security;Cyberattack","","","","36","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On continuous models we got mean absolute error close or less to 10, when range of test result was 0-100 points. Most of our attributes were subject grades on scale 1-5, and therefore, as we limited our testing sample with one school only, it gave interesting insights into how some subjects and teachers do contribute to final test results. And, surprisingly, it turned out, that for some test result, most significant predictor was negatively correlated to the result. It means that having bad grades in some subjects was a good predictor of success in final test.

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3392830","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:EdUHK CB326,CB357); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10507034","Generative artificial intelligence;human-centered;learning and teaching framework;pedagogical design;self-regulated learning (SRL)","Generative AI;Education;Artificial intelligence;Learning (artificial intelligence);Guidelines;Task analysis;Transformers","","11","","51","CCBY","23 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Students who are better prepared coming out of high school are ideally suited to do well in higher education institutions, who they are, how much money they have, and where they go don't matter. This review aims to identify effective features that warrant student success from high school grades and choice of academic courses during registration in higher education. The following questions are used to guide this review: How can we define student success? Which features should we focus on? Which models work? Based on data mining techniques such as machine learning models that the previous studies have used to predict student success, it has been revealed that the most important features that influence student success in a Computer Science programme are Prior Computer experience, Mathematics, English from High school and the choice of a course.","","978-1-6654-4067-7","10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422519","National Research foundation of South Africa(grant numbers:121835); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9422519","Student success;Prediction;Higher Education;Machine Learning","Computer science;Mechatronics;Computational modeling;Conferences;Education;Machine learning;Predictive models","","1","","15","IEEE","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims to predict students' performance in mathematics using the K-fold approach to support effective decision-making and policy implementation on mathematics. The primary dataset was collected from 192 senior secondary schools, and one mathematics student was randomly selected from five Senior Secondary Schools in Bwari Area Council, Abuja, and used as a sample. Students' Mathematics Achievement Test (SMAT) was used as the instrument to collect data. The data was processed and modelled using the Python Programming language. Thus, five machine learning models were trained and evaluated to overcome overfitting using four-, five---, and six-fold K-Fold cross-validation techniques. Five folds performed best for all the models except for the Support Vector Regressor, which performed best with six folds. The evaluation of the models showed that the Light Gradient Boosting Model outperformed others with a Mean Absolute Error of 12.642 and a Root Mean Square Error of 15.894. The models were significantly influenced by the students' personal study time, friends' assistance, and the parents' educational background. It is therefore recommended that academic researchers, educational authorities in Nigeria, and relevant stakeholders use and improve on this model to predict the students' scores and assist them in achieving great performance in mathematics.","","979-8-3503-5815-5","10.1109/SEB4SDG60871.2024.10630249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10630249","K-fold approach;Machine learning models;Mathematics;Prediction;SMAT","Instruments;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Mathematics;Vectors;Stakeholders;Sustainable development;Root mean square;STEM;Python","","","","52","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9–12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.","2689-1808","","10.1109/TQE.2021.3127503","U.S. Department of Commerce(grant numbers:BS123456); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; IBM Canada Ltd.; IBM Center for Advanced Studies; University of Victoria; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613752","Computer science (CS) unplugged (CS Unplugged);education;entanglement;high-school-aged youth;measurement;qiskit;quantum computing;quantum computing games;quantum gates;quantum teleportation;qubit systems;superposition;teachers;training;workforce development","Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Conferences;Qubit;Programming profession;Industries;Software","","16","","86","CCBY","12 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working.","","978-1-6654-8303-2","10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720806","prediction;students performance;classification;machine learning;interpretable explanation;LIME","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Sensitivity;Conferences;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Mathematical models","","35","","26","IEEE","4 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs.

This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes.

As the use of GAI in learning grows increasingly prevalent among students, its adoption varies greatly from one individual to another. Despite this growing trend, research on students' use and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. In our study, we employed a mixed-methods, multiple-case study design to explore the impact of GAI on students across four grades. We focused on six key areas: learning interest, independent learning, problem-solving, confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Our results revealed that participants had optimistic expectations regarding the utilisation of GAI to facilitate their learning. They believed that GAI could contribute positively to all six dimensions, enhancing their educational experience. We found that college students exhibited a higher level of performance than high school students across all six aspects. The insights we gained from this study can inform future research in digital education, particularly in understanding the diverse ways in which students interact with and perceive GAI. By recognizing the potential of GAI in transforming education, educators and policymakers can better harness its capabilities to enhance teaching and learning experiences.

In this sense, the academic achievement of students is an indicator that allows measuring the quality of education offered by educational systems. One way to measure academic achievement is through the results of standardized tests, as is the case of PLANEA in Mexico. This research paper presents the analysis of academic achievement in mathematics of high-middle education students in Veracruz, through an approach based on computational intelligence. For this, an unsupervised learning approach based on K-means was used, an algorithm that models a set of input variables and assigns elements (data vectors) with similar characteristics to certain clusters. The solution method was divided into four stages: data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, variable selection, and algorithm application. As a result, a differentiated segmentation was observed for the evaluation period. From this segmentation, some characteristics stand out in each group were identified, such as: the shift, degree of marginalization, support, programmed students and evaluated students.","","979-8-3503-2883-7","10.1109/CONISOFT58849.2023.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10568256","Higher-middle education;computational intelligence;mathematics;academic achievement","Machine learning algorithms;Input variables;Education;Clustering algorithms;Vectors;Object recognition;Cultural differences","","","","28","IEEE","27 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study aimed at tackling the wrong placement of applicants into courses and to also address the wastage of admission vacancies by recommending the appropriate course(s). About 8,700 data for three academic sessions were collected from two different universities for training and testing the system. The features used are the results of Senior Secondary School subjects and the average score of UTME and Post-UTME. The proposed system employed five (5) classification models, which include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Algorithm. The Linear Regression Model has the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as 2. 614 e-14 The other four (4) classification models are also found to be efficient with an efficiency of at least 90% sequel to the dimensionality reduction in the dataset. The result shows that both Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine have achieved the highest recommendation accuracy of approximately 99.94%, which outperformed Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms with an accuracy of 98.10% and 99.87% respectively. The system can be adjusted with the change of admission criteria in Nigerian Universities. In consideration of the high degree of prediction accuracy, flexibility is an advantage, as the system can predict suitable courses that match the students' grades. Therefore, the system is adaptive and good in making the prediction and can be used as a framework for further research on the admission recommender system.","","978-1-7281-3126-9","10.1109/ICMCECS47690.2020.240882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9077626","University;Admission;Recommender;Prediction;Classifiers","","","12","","15","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, growth in these algorithms means growth in algorithmic bias, and it is imperative that we work to understand the bias that may result. One area of study in which these algorithms are widely used is in educational institutions. The algorithms are often used to predict student success or retention. In our research, we aim to uncover the biases that may result from building and using a machine learning student success models. To do so, we used two publicly available student datasets from educational settings (one from a MOOC and another one from secondary education in Portugal) and built models of our own. We then compared the accuracy and the fairness of each model type to observe which models performed best on each subcategory of students. Among the models we built, we found that while it is easy to use accuracy to evaluate models and find the most accurate ones, the most accurate predictive model overall for a dataset may not perform fairly in predicting student success for all subcategories of students. To better tune models for fairness, we found that it is possible to tune models that also take fairness into consideration, and these models could perform more fairly on almost all subcategories of students, but it slightly took away from the accuracy of the algorithm. Our results demonstrate the importance of creating and tuning several model types in order to choose a balanced model that balances accuracy and fairness.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-9117-4","10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148378","Educational data mining;algorithmic bias;machine learning","Computer aided instruction;Machine learning algorithms;Electronic learning;Education;Buildings;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","1","","17","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the advantages brought by online learning in continuing learners' learning experiences and improving learners' academic performance during the pandemic, it is still of vital importance to examine what factors are sensitive to changes in learner's online academic performance. In this study, sensitive factors affecting online academic performance are examined through the lens of machine learning (ML) methods: Boruta algorithm (BA) for feature selection; multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) for model formulation; and partial derivatives method (PDM) for sensitivity analysis. Data used in the analysis are responses in the survey participated by N = 978 senior high and junior school students of a private high school institution in the Philippines. Out of eighteen factors considered in the analysis, BA revealed only six relevant factors that contributes greater information to changes in student's online academic performance. Formulated MLP NN model achieved a high testing accuracy of 0.932 with a kappa coefficient of 0.891 and an f - measure of 0.924, that aided the sensitivity analysis using PDM to have better results. Sensitivity analysis showed that motivation and mental well- being are the most sensitive factors affecting both below average and above average online academic performance.","","978-1-6654-6521-2","10.1109/LACLO56648.2022.10013373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013373","machine learning;sensitivity analysis;mental well - being;online academic performance;motivation;new normal","Computer aided instruction;Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Sensitivity analysis;Pandemics;Machine learning;Artificial neural networks","","","","36","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in many cases, teachers have neither the necessary background to efficiently use these kits nor the information about how students are using robotics in classroom. To support teachers, learning environments with robotics tools should monitor the students' interaction data while they are interacting with the different resources provided. With the analysis of this data, teachers can obtain valuable information about students' learning progress. In previous work, we presented integrated didactic educational environment (IDEE), an integrated learning environment that uses robotics to support physics laboratories in secondary education. Students' interactions with IDEE are stored and analyzed using the additive factor model to show the teachers the most significant skills in the learning process and those students who have difficulties with these skills. Now, our goal is to enhance the information given to the teachers to allow them to focus on the specific needs of each student on every different skill involved in the activities and not only the significant skills. To this end, we use a conjunctive knowledge tracing model based on a hidden Markov model. In this article: first, we describe how the CKT model has been adapted to the pedagogical model of IDEE, second, we show that this model can identify the skills that each student masters, and thus, support teachers in identifying learning criticalities in students.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3339882","Italian Ministry “Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universitá e della Ricerca,” MIUR(grant numbers:488/2001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10345689","Computer-assisted instruction;intelligent tutoring systems;learning environments;science, technologies, engineering and mathematics (STEM)","Robots;Education;Hidden Markov models;Programming profession;Physics;Mathematical models;Analytical models","","2","","44","CCBYNCND","6 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two strategies of using and training the whole neural network implementing SurvBeNIM are proposed. The first one explains a single instance, and the neural network is trained for each explained instance. According to the second strategy, the neural network only learns once on all instances from the dataset and on all generated instances. Then the neural network is used to explain any instance in a dataset domain. Various numerical experiments compare the method with different existing explanation methods developed for survival analysis, in particular, for models SurvBex, SurvNAM, and SurvLIME.

The need and motivation for such systems are very well-established and thus the aim of this work is to develop a system based on modified machine learning models to automatically predict students’ performance and subsequently identify students at risk. The DEEDs dataset is used in this study. Novel features were extracted and applied to well-known classifiers some of which are ensemble classifiers. These classifiers were also combined with base learners such as bagging and boosting. The problem was divided into three scenarios; binary classification of the pass and fail, three class scenarios, and four class scenarios. It was shown that ensemble methods combined with base learners of boosting and bagging significantly increase the accuracy for binary classification, slightly increase accuracy for three class problems, and have no significance in increasing the accuracy when the problem is 4 classes. The ensemble algorithm of bagging and boosting FDT achieved an accuracy of 98.25% for binary classification and 89.47% for three classes. The standard ensemble FDT achieved an accuracy of 77.19% for four classes.

Those who are getting higher results are given opportunities to attend well-facilitated schools for secondary education. Due to that case, there is a massive competition for passing the examination. Limitless pressure for examination provides lots of issues to students. This paper uses data to investigate a model of academic performance as measured by past results of school tests of Grade 4 and Grade 5. 500 students from eight primary schools in the Gampaha district have been selected for collecting data. The Data on the above-mentioned students have been collected by conducting questionnaires to the teachers who in-charged the classes. Then the Logistic Regression model and Multiple Linear Regression model have been applied to predict students' performances at the examination. The model depicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing the grade 5 scholarship examination and predicts the range of results that students will obtain in the examination. The accuracy of predictive models is measured using the results of students who have already faced the Grade 5 examination. Revealing the potential of students at the grade 5 examination is heavily benefited by teachers because they can provide personalized education for talented students and provide opportunities to other students to improve their talents.

To overcome these challenges, the tertiary educational institutions endeavor to implement interventions geared toward academic success. One of the challenges, however, is identifying the vulnerable students in a timely manner. This study therefore aims to predict student performance by using a learner attrition model so that the vulnerable students are identified early on in the academic year and are provided support through effective interventions, thereby impacting student success positively. Predictive machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and logistic regression, were trained to deduce the students into four risk-profiles. A random forest outperformed other classifiers in predicting at-risk student profiles with an accuracy of 85%, kappa statistic of 0.7, and an AUC of 0.95.

Furthermore, most escape room implementations lack relevance to real-world situations and challenges with using AI systems in the wild. This study explores the effectiveness of an escape room, DRONEscape, as a tool for teaching AI concepts to Air Force participants. The results suggest that escape rooms can most effectively facilitate engagement and collaboration, and have positive effects on learning AI concepts.

The STEM education provides courses to educate students in four disciplines, i.e. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, transforming current industry to a modern industry needs the support from a group of professional people who are familiar with the core technologies of ID 4.0, such as virtual and real Integration systems, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence(AI). Programming is the key to make the above industrial revolution success. Thus, our previous project developed a low cost humanoid robot as a learning tool applied in STEM programs. With the assistance of the humanoid robot, young students can learn programming courses easily and efficiently. Currently, STEM education is often applied in elementary, junior-high and senior-high schools. It really improves students' learning circumstance in STEM fields. This paper introduced the STEAM education model to create a good learning circumstance for art students. Digital teaching aids, such as humanoid robot, and quadruped mechanical animal, support students to learn STEM programs more intuitively. Those aids can help students to learn mechanical mechanisms, electronic motors, digital control and programming and so on. These teaching aids are all open source, and they can be printed by 3D printers. Students can learn mechanics, electronics, and programming via the course. In order to enable students to use the humanoid robot digital teaching aids more effectively and completely, a humanoid robot motion editor is developed. This editor was developed by python and VTK, and it also has a friendly window-based interface. Its main task is to provide students to edit the motion of the robots quickly and easily.

Predicting student test scores is difficult. However, doing so can improve education greatly by improving advising, scheduling, tutoring assignment and other educational processes. This research extends previous research by using a domain space reduction technique to improve accuracy. Factor Analysis is used to reduce the number of domain attributes for improving the accuracy of a Neural Network to predict student test scores. In this research datasets for Mathematics and Language of high school student test scores were used. Test scores were predicted using a Neural Network computing the Mean Absolute Error as a measurement of accuracy. The datasets have 30 domain attributes each. Factor Analysis was used to reduce the domain size from between 1 to 29, each time using it to train the Neural Network. Because the Mean Absolute Error may vary depending upon which records in the dataset are used for training versus testing, 50 trials of each dataset size were executed producing an Average Mean Absolute Error for each domain size. A statistical test was used to show statistical significance between the Neural Network without Factor Analysis and the Neural Network with varying domain sizes using Factor Analysis. Results were very promising and correspond to previous research that used Principal Component Analysis. Numerous domain sizes had significantly better Average Mean Absolute Errors than the accuracy of the Neural Network without Factor Analysis. This research shows that reducing the domain size using Factor Analysis can greatly improve the accuracy of Neural Networks when predicting student test scores. The best improvements occurred when domain sizes were very small ranging from 2 to 6. Domain reduction techniques, such as Factor Analysis, have been shown to improve predictive models for student test score prediction. Future research should consider other domain reduction techniques, like T-SNE, in combination with other predictive models, like Support Vector Machines.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893065","Factor Analysis;High School;Neural Networks;Predicting Student Test Scores;Domain Space Reduction;Domain Reduction;Predictive Models","Training;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Neural networks;Measurement uncertainty;Predictive models;Nearest neighbor methods;Mathematical models;Testing;Principal component analysis","","","","30","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learners’ LM are classified through the use of an Algorithm for Learning Delivery Modality as recommended by DepEd. Based on initial investigation, mismatches in learners’ LM were, however, observed, resulting in learners’ massive shifting from one LM to another in the middle of the school year. In this study, we introduced an approach to classifying learner’s LM using machine learning (ML) techniques. We compared the effectiveness of five ML classifiers, namely the random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Learner’s enrolment and survey form (LESF) data from the repository of a local private high school in the Philippines is used in model formulation. We also compared three existing feature selection (FS) algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta algorithm (BA), and ReliefF)–integrated into the five ML classifiers as data feature reduction techniques. Results show that the combination of MLP NN and BA yielded a considerably high performance among the rest of the formulated models.

To achieve this objective, machine learning algorithms such as the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were implemented. From a question bank containing 1,300 questions covering Algebra (A), Advanced Algebra (AA), Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (T), Analytic Geometry (AG), and Solid Mensuration (SM), five domain experts identified the suitability of the questions as part of a diagnostic examination in mathematics. Specifically, using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being the highest), the experts rated the suitability of each question to test the proficiency of a student in 23 mathematics competencies based on what is prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The collected survey data were then used to train the machine learning models, which extracted patterns to identify the questions that would be most suitable to test the mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students. With a precision recall score of 99.90%, the LR model was selected as the best performing model and analysis of how the LR model predicts the labels through the use of shap values revealed that the preference was given towards questions which test student proficiency in foundational mathematics competencies like that of Algebra and Analytical Geometry. Overall, these findings provided a better understanding of the questions that are most effective in discriminating student deficiencies in mathematics subjects.","","979-8-3503-0064-2","10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137793","","Geometry;Surveys;Analytical models;Algebra;Predictive models;Solids;Reliability engineering","","","","26","IEEE","31 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, in engineering schools, where one of the major challenges is to train students in different sectors of activity, the presence of students is fundamental during these courses, unlike in faculties where attendance is not mandatory during lectures. In the face of massification in digital universities, the management of attendance and fraud during evaluations becomes fundamental to the credibility of the diplomas issued. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based facial recognition system for attendance and fraud management in engineering schools and digital universities. Attendance and exam fraud management play a very important role in the training of learners. The use of this system saves a lot of time by eliminating the attendance management step by automating it while detecting fraud during exams. The solution consists of a student, course and schedule management application coupled with a facial recognition system. It detects the presence of learners during scheduled lessons and assessments through facial recognition.","","979-8-3503-2297-2","10.1109/ICECCME57830.2023.10252290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10252290","Artificial Intelligence;Deep learning;Face Recognition;Students attendance;Fraud","Training;Deep learning;Schedules;Mechatronics;Face recognition;Fraud","","1","","15","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we conducted a rigorous study on the effects on learning by subjecting classes of students to an experience of these emerging technologies and measuring their feelings before and after the experiment through questionnaires. We carried out the research involving three high schools and a total of 162 students aged between 15 and 20. During the meetings, we made available two applications that we developed. The first is a Virtual Reality environment that enables the user to explore a room in which the system spawns three-dimensional objects defined by the teacher. The objects may represent mathematical functions, physics simulations, scenes relating to historical re-enactments, etc. The second is an Augmented Reality smartphone application that allows three-dimensional figures to be observed via the smartphone screen by framing a marker printed on paper. Both applications are realised with free software, trying to minimise the technical requirements for their operation and guaranteeing reliability and usability. The work concludes by analysing the results obtained and comparing the effectiveness of the two technologies tested. Results of tests conducted in three Italian schools show that Augmented Reality is seen as a useful tool in education by about 94.43%. Importantly, the use of these technologies requires an inclusive design that involves all students, regardless of their level of familiarity with the technology. The overall analysis reveals that both technologies performed well, and students value them for their intuitiveness and level of immersion.

In this paper, we propose a method to represent the model by combining these kinds of knowledge, called the Rela-Ops model. This model includes foundation components consisting of concepts, relations, operators, and inference rules. It is built based on ontology and object-oriented approaches. Besides the structure, each concept of the Rela-Ops model is a class of objects which also have behaviors to solve problems on their own. The processing of algorithms for solving problems on the Rela-Ops model combines the knowledge of relations and operators in the reasoning. Furthermore, we also propose a knowledge model for multiple knowledge domains, in which each sub-domain has the form as the Rela-Ops model. These representation methods have been applied to build knowledge bases of Intelligent Problems Solver (IPS) in mathematics. The knowledge base of 2D-Analytical Geometry in a high-school is built by using the Rela-Ops model, and the knowledge base of Linear Algebra in university is designed by using the model for multiple knowledge domains. The IPS system can automatically solve basic and advanced exercises in respective courses. The reasoning of their solutions is done in a step-by-step approach. It is similar to the solving method by humans.

Furthermore, through a novel gain-scheduled state observer, the fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The dynamic surface design method is used to remove the need for derivative calculations of the constructed virtual controls, significantly the complexity of calculations. In addition, under the framework of backstepping design, the switching threshold event-triggered control strategy is developed to effectively decrease the communication load and balance the performance of MASs. The proposed control protocol ensures that all signals within the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded under the MDADT switching property.

This study proposes a task-offloading technique using a fuzzy decision-making method to deal with ambiguity and uncertainties to solve these problems. Roadside Utilities (RSUs) placed alongside remote roadways typically have limited energy resources, thus they must offer energy-effective planning assistance with the distribution of duties to VEC. However, planning decisions for regional task execution incur computational costs, and assigning duties to edge automobiles incurs transmission costs, making energy usage management difficult. Task data transmission to edge automobiles results in increased RSU power usage even while task offloading lowers response delay. To meet task schedule and supply restrictions, this study proposes an energy-effective automobile planning issue for offloading functions to mobile edge units. This study develops a planning technique depending on on-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a fuzzy-based DRL to address the extremely complex problem brought on by a rise in the number of automobiles under RSU service. When contrasted to the Q-learning method, this FRL not only speeds up the learning procedure but also enhances long-term payoff.","","979-8-3315-1857-8","10.1109/CE2CT64011.2025.10941321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10941321","Edge computing;Internet of things;Vechilce;Task off-loading;Fuzzy-logic;Deep reinforcement learning","Schedules;Uncertainty;Q-learning;Decision making;Deep reinforcement learning;Real-time systems;Delays;Automobiles;Standards;Edge computing","","","","21","IEEE","2 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate these problems, we propose a new multi-hop routing clustering protocol for a wide range of 3DWSNs. In terms of clustering, nodes will run for cluster head (CH) by timing broadcast based on their remaining energy and their average distance from surrounding nodes. Two new identity nodes are added between the CH and the member nodes, the load transfer node responsible for transferring the energy consumption of the CH, and the secondary cluster head node (SCH) acting as the CH for the next round. In order to reduce energy consumption in key node areas, we also enable key nodes to communicate directly with the sink node. In the aspect of routing construction, SN generates the routing table corresponding to each CH through our proposed fragile ant colony algorithm. Because CH and SCH exist at the same time and have a certain replacement order, the SN only needs to obtain the location of each CH when the network is first clustered, and can continuously generate a new routing table corresponding to the CH, which reduces the energy consumption of the network in the routing path construction. We simulate this protocol, LEACH protocol, AZ-SEP protocol, and UCNPD protocol in a three-dimensional environment. The results show that this protocol is better than the other three protocols in terms of network lifetime and network load balance, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982691","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701284,61472229,31671588); Science and Technology Development Fund of Shandong Province of China(grant numbers:2016ZDJS02A11,ZR2017MF027); Innovative Research Foundation of Qingdao(grant numbers:19-6-2-1-cg); Application Research Project for Postdoctoral Researchers of Qingdao, the Humanities and Social Science Research Project of the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:18YJAZH017); Taishan Scholar Climbing Program of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ts2090936); SDUST Research Fund(grant numbers:2015TDJH102); Science and Technology Support Plan of Youth Innovation Team of Shandong higher School(grant numbers:2019KJN024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044847","3DWSNs;clustering algorithm;routing algorithm;network lifetime;network load balancing","Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Energy consumption;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","","22","","23","CCBY","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
