In this context, the development and securing of human resources in mathematics, data science, and AI are urgent issues to promote technological innovation in the future. In this paper, a teaching material specializing in chassis of the vehicle performance in junior high school technology education was developed. The students manufactured their own teaching materials and evaluated them based on the data. The problems were identified and redesigned and remanufactured to solve them. The proposed class was practiced by students who were going to become teachers in a teacher training course, junior high school technology education. The results showed the educational effect of the material. In addition, a 13-h lesson plan that is the basis of The Lower Secondary School National Curriculum Standard was proposed.

Daoudi, Mohammed;Moroccan Teachers' Perceptions About Integrating Historical Contexts and AI in the Seamless Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics;AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION;10.1080/18117295.2025.2460911;"Article; Early Access";2025;This article critically examines deficiencies in the final year high school programme, particularly in the Physics-Chemistry and Mathematics A and B specialties, focusing on the inadequate transition from classical to quantum mechanics. Based on teachers' perceptions, the study analyses the value of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and historical science narratives to address the complex relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The analysis reveals a disjointed narrative hindering students' understanding during the critical transition phase, emphasising the insufficiency of a single lesson, 'Atom and Newton's Mechanics' at the academic year's end. The proposed comprehensive methodology for curriculum revision aims to seamlessly integrate historical narratives into the educational framework, providing a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness between classical and quantum mechanics. The discussion emphasises the potential positive impacts on student engagement, comprehension and enthusiasm for physics, extending beyond content adjustments to transform pedagogical strategies. The conclusion highlights the broader significance of these changes for science education, suggesting a curriculum overhaul informed by historical narratives and AI integration could shape a generation of scientifically literate individuals, adept at navigating contemporary physics complexities. The article serves as a call to action for teachers, curriculum developers and policymakers to innovate high school science education in line with the dynamic nature of scientific discovery.;1811-7295;2469-7656
"Cetinkaya, Ali; Baykan, Omer Kaan; Kirgiz, Havva";Analysis of Machine Learning Classification Approaches for Predicting Students' Programming Aptitude;SUSTAINABILITY;10.3390/su151712917;Article;2023;With the increasing prevalence and significance of computer programming, a crucial challenge that lies ahead of teachers and parents is to identify students adept at computer programming and direct them to relevant programming fields. As most studies on students' coding abilities focus on elementary, high school, and university students in developed countries, we aimed to determine the coding abilities of middle school students in Turkey. We first administered a three-part spatial test to 600 secondary school students, of whom 400 completed the survey and the 20-level Classic Maze course on Code.org. We then employed four machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and quadratic discriminant to classify the coding abilities of these students using spatial test and Code.org platform data. SVM yielded the most accurate results and can thus be considered a suitable ML technique to determine the coding abilities of participants. This article promotes quality education and coding skills for workforce development and sustainable industrialization, aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.;;2071-1050
"Rebai, Sonia; Ben Yahia, Fatma; Essid, Hedi";A graphically based machine learning approach to predict secondary schools performance in Tunisia;SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES;10.1016/j.seps.2019.06.009;Article;2020;The main purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that impact schools' academic performance and to explore their relationships through a two-stage analysis based on a sample of Tunisian secondary schools. In the first stage, we use the Directional Distance Function approach (DDF) to deal with undesirable outputs. The DDF is estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis method (DEA). In the second stage we apply machine-learning approaches (regression trees and random forests) to identify and visualize variables that are associated with a high school performance. The data is extracted from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 survey. The first stage analysis shows that almost 22% of Tunisian schools are efficient and that they could improve their students' educational performance by 15.6% while using the same level of resources. Regression trees findings indicate that the most important factors associated with higher performance are school size, competition, class size, parental pressure and proportion of girls. Only, school location appears with no impact on school efficiency. Random forests algorithm outcomes display that proportion of girls at school and school size have the most powerful impact on the predictive accuracy of our model and hence could more influence school efficiency. The findings disclose also the high non-linearity of the relationships between these key factors and school performance and reveal the importance of modeling their interactions in influencing efficiency scores.;0038-0121;1873-6041

Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance.Purpose/Hypothesis This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice.Design/Method Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked.Results Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school.Conclusions Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering.";1069-4730;2168-9830
"Yu, Yang; Fan, Jinfu; Xian, Yuanqing; Wang, Zhongjie";Graph Neural Network for Senior High Student's Grade Prediction;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;10.3390/app12083881;Article;2022;Senior high school education (SHSE) forms a connecting link between the preceding junior high school education and the following college education. Through SHSE, a student not only completes k-12 education, but also lays a foundation for subsequent higher education. The grade of the student in SHSE plays a critical role in college application and admission. Therefore, utilizing the grade of the student as an indicator is a reasonable method to instruct and ensure the effect of SHSE. However, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the grade prediction problem, it is hard to predict the grade accurately. In this paper, a novel grade prediction model aiming to handle the complexity and nonlinearity is proposed to accurately predict the grade of the senior high student. To deal with the complexity, a graph structure is employed to represent the students' grades in all subjects. To handle the nonlinearity, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to learn (or fit) the inner relation of the subject grades. The proposed grade prediction model based on graph neural network is tested on the dataset of Ningbo Xiaoshi High School. The results show that the proposed method performs well in the prediction of senior high school student grades.;;2076-3417
"Lockhart, Mary Elizabeth; Kwok, Oi-Man; Yoon, Myeongsun; Wong, Raymond";An important component to investigating STEM persistence: the development and validation of the science identity (SciID) scale;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION;10.1186/s40594-022-00351-1;Article;2022;Background Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) influence almost every aspect of our daily lives. However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. Science identity has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students' science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach's alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student's standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students' science identity.;2196-7822;

The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants' diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system's effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students' mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective.";;2071-1050

Secondary school mathematics terminology plays a guiding role in the learning and teaching of secondary school mathematics. We found that there needs to be more work in this field and that there are two main issues in extracting the terms from the middle school mathematics text: the polysemy of one character problem and nested terms problem. Accordingly, we have constructed a secondary school mathematics corpus and proposed a model to resolve these problems, termed BERT-LLA-CRF. Using pretraining to obtain dynamic word vectors to improve the model's understanding of text semantics and solve the problem of multiple meanings of one word, the proposed model integrates attention mechanisms and Chinese character information to solve the nested terminology problem. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively solves those problems and achieves good middle-school mathematics term extraction results.;1541-1672;1941-1294

"Souto-Maior, Joao M.; Shroff, Ravi";Differences in Academic Preparedness Do Not Fully Explain Black-White Enrollment Disparities in Ad-vanced High School Coursework;SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE;10.15195/v11.a6;Article;2024;Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central question in sociological research and education policy. However, previous investigations face methodological limitations, for they compare race -specific enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to their academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently -developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students' academic preparedness and use administrative data from the New York City Department of Education to measure differences in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under -representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only requires equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes.;;2330-6696

The adaptive learning system is emerging as a promising approach to achieving personalized learning. The cognitive model plays a crucial role as the fundamental rationale behind the adaptive learning system. Currently, there is no uniform and highly operational method for constructing cognitive models. This study adopts Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) as the foundational approach for constructing a cognitive model of solid geometry. Based on literature and expert opinions, 17 cognitive attributes of high school solid geometry were identified. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey involving 40 experts was conducted to establish the contextual relationships among these attributes. Applying the ISM method resulted in a sevenlevel model. This model was then revised based on expert opinions to create the final cognitive model, revealing three primary paths within the domain of high school solid geometry. This paper contends that the use of the ISM method for constructing cognitive models is effective and objective. The resulting cognitive model unveils the content structure of high school solid geometry, and provides an innovative perspective on the construction of cognitive models.;;2405-8440

The incidence of SI among high (junior and senior) school students is significantly higher than that of other age groups. The aim of this study is to explore the gender differences in SI among high school students in Yunnan Province. Method: A total of 6180 students in grades 7-12 in Yunnan province, China from May 2021 to May 2022 participated in this survey. Univariate analysis was employed to describe the influencing factors of male and female students' SI. Subsequently, data were stratified by gender. Adopting machine learning technique, including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and Boruta algorithm, and logistic regression model to estimate the direction and effect magnitude of the influencing factors. Results: The prevalence of SI was significantly higher for females (31.34 %) than males (16.73 %). The logistic regression model was established using the variables screened by Boruta algorithm, indicated that anxiety, depression, suffering emotion abuse or emotion neglect in childhood, non-suicidal self-injury, evening chronotype are common risk factors for SI in male and female students. Notably, female students who exhibited aggressive behavior, have experienced bullying, and were in the junior high school learning stage were more likely to report SI than their male counterparts. Conclusions: Females showed more vulnerability to SI than males especially among females in junior high school, reporting aggressive behavior and bullying experiences. Tailored prevention strategies, informed by these gender-related distinctions, should be developed and implemented.;0165-0327;1573-2517

Introductions of complex subjects in high school promotes student efficacy, enthusiasm, and skill-development for STEM careers. Establishing strong partnerships between universities and high schools is mutually beneficial for the professional development of students, teachers, and professors. In this paper, we detail immersive outreach efforts and their effectiveness in a high school setting.Methods From Spring 2021 to Spring 2024, we conducted eight data-science and analysis-coding style workshops along with two data science units, with 302 students participating in the data science workshops and 82 students in the data science units. All students who participated in the data science lessons completed a comprehensive final project. Surveys measuring knowledge and appeal to data science and coding were conducted both retrospectively and prospectively, before and after each workshop and the data science units. A 1 year follow up survey was conducted for students in the 2023 data science lessons (n = 23).Results Overall, average student interest significantly increased from 2.72 +/- 1.08/5.0 (n = 205) to 3.15 +/- 1.18/5.0 (n = 181, p = 0.001) during the data science workshops, while 70% of students expressed desire to continue with coding.

A multilinear regression model is used in parallel with random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting machine stacking ensemble implementations. Designing a hybrid analysis is intended where classical statistical analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms are blended to augment the ability to retain valuable conclusions and well-supported results. The machine learning algorithms attain a higher level of predictive ability. In addition, the stacking appropriateness increases as the base learner output correlation matrix determinant increases and the random forest feature importance empirical distributions are correlated with the structure ofp-values and the statistical significance test ascertains of the multiple linear model. An information system that supports the nationwide education system should be designed and further structured to collect meaningful and precise data about the full range of academic achievement antecedents.

This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, aims to explore the relationship between math anxiety and the intention to use AI for solving math problems among high school students. Using the Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the AI Problem-Solving Behavior Scale (AIPS), data from 391 high school students were collected. The analysis revealed the following: (1) Students report high levels of math anxiety and a strong inclination to use AI tools for solving math problems; (2) Social support plays a significant role in alleviating math anxiety, with family support being the most effective, followed by support from friends and teachers; (3) High levels of family support are the most effective means of reducing math anxiety. The study suggests that the relationship between math anxiety and AI use intention should be addressed, with a focus on regulating the application of AI in math education to promote its scientific and effective use. Additionally, improving family relationships and providing mental health support are recommended to alleviate math anxiety from an emotional and social support perspective.

"Assiri, Basem; Bashraheel, Mohammed; Alsuri, Ala";Enhanced Student Admission Procedures at Universities Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;10.3390/app14031109;Article;2024;The progress of technology has played a crucial role in enhancing various fields such as education. Universities in Saudi Arabia offer free education to students and follow specific admission policies. These policies usually focus on features and scores such as the high school grade point average, general aptitude test, and achievement test. The main issue with current admission policies is that they do not fit with all majors, which results in high rates of failure, dropouts, and transfer. Another issue is that all mentioned features and scores are cumulatively calculated, which obscures some details. Therefore, this study aims to explore admission criteria used in Saudi Arabian universities and the factors that influence students' choice of major. First, using data mining techniques, the research analyzes the relationships and similarities between the university's grade point average and the other student admission features. The study proposes a new Jaccard model that includes modified Jaccard and approximated modified Jaccard techniques to match the specifications of students' data records. It also uses data distribution analysis and correlation coefficient analysis to understand the relationships between admission features and student performance. The investigation shows that relationships vary from one major to another. Such variations emphasize the weakness of the generalization of the current procedures since they are not applicable to all majors. Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of hidden details such as high school course grades. Second, this study employs machine learning models to incorporate additional features, such as high school course grades, to find suitable majors for students. The K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine algorithms were used to classify students into appropriate majors. This process significantly improves the enrolment of students in majors that align with their skills and interests. The results of the experimental simulation indicate that the K-nearest neighbor algorithm achieves the highest accuracy rate of 100%, while the decision tree algorithm's accuracy rate is 81% and the support vector machine algorithm's accuracy rate is 75%. This encourages the idea of using machine learning models to find a suitable major for applicants.;;2076-3417

For this, data from a total of 258,440 students were used to generate automated models to predict students at risk of failure or dropping out. Data were collected from primary and secondary education from different sources and for the period between 2015 and 2020. Such data contains demographic information about the students and their trajectories from the first grade of primary school to the second grade of secondary school (e.g., student assessments in different subjects over the years, the amount of absences, participation in social welfare programs, and the zone of the school, among other factors). Predictive models using the random forest algorithm were trained, and their performances were evaluated with F1-Macro and AUROC measures. The models were planned to be applied in different periods of the school year for the regular secondary school and for the technical secondary school ((before the beginning of the school year and after the first evaluation meeting for each grade). A total of eight predictive models were developed considering this temporal approach, and after an analysis of bias considering three protected attributes (gender, school zone, and social welfare program participation), seven of them were approved to be used for prediction. The models achieved outstanding performances according to the literature, with an AUROC higher than 0.90 and F1-Macro higher than 0.88. This paper describes in depth the characteristics of the data gathered, the specifics of data preprocessing, and the methodology followed for model generation and bias analysis, together with the architecture developed for the deployment of the predictive models. Among other findings, the results of the paper corroborate the importance given in the literature of using the previous performances of the students in order to predict their future performances.;;2078-2489

This study aimed to develop and apply a method to predict state-level proportions of high school students identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) or reporting any same-sex sexual contacts in those states that did not include these questions in their 2017 YRBS.Methods We used state-level high school YRBS data from 2013, 2015, and 2017. We defined two primary outcomes relating to self-reported LGB identity and reported same-sex sexual contacts. We developed machine learning models to predict the two outcomes based on other YRBS variables, and comparing different modeling approaches. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation approach and report results from best-performing models.Results Modern ensemble models outperformed traditional linear models at predicting state-level proportions for the two outcomes, and we identified prediction methods that performed well across different years and prediction tasks. Predicted proportions of respondents reporting LGB identity in states that did not include direct measurement ranged between 9.4% and 12.9%. Predicted proportions of respondents reporting any same-sex contacts, where not directly observed, ranged between 7.0% and 10.4%.Conclusion Comparable population estimates of sexual minority adolescents can raise awareness among state policy makers and the public about what proportion of youth may be exposed to disparate health risks and outcomes associated with sexual minority status. This information can help decision makers in public health and education agencies design, implement and evaluate community and school interventions to improve the health of LGB youth.;1932-6203;

Through our established partnerships with schools in California and Kansas, we have developed educational tools to positively influence the learning and career paths of young high school (HS) students from underserved districts and underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Through the development of new curricula, teaching modules, and shared resources that are made broadly available to other school districts, this work has the potential to impact a large number of K-12 teachers and students. We have been working to train HS teachers to create connections between the STEM subjects they teach students with advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that are often taught only post-HS. It creates a context where students can see how their STEM skills can be applied and a pathway of continuing STEM education from secondary to post-secondary. As a result, there is the potential to improve student interest and self-efficacy in STEM and to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Furthermore, AI is key to understanding and making use of data and solving many control problems. We aim to help students learn the fundamentals of how AI algorithms are applied in contemporary neuroscience. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.;2405-8963;

One way to achieve this is by introducing various teaching methods, one of which is tandem learning, which is a small-group cooperative learning method. Not everyone responds well to a one-size-fits-all method, and therefore, uncovering insights for predictive model selection tailored to individual students or classrooms becomes imperative for teaching institutions. The knowledge is embedded in the educational data set and is extractable through data mining techniques. The primary objective of the study was to identify the key factors that significantly influence student outcomes (including both emotional well-being and knowledge improvement) in tandem learning using machine learning algorithms. The study was conducted in a mathematics class during the course of one week of tandem learning implementation in the school year 2023/24 with a sample of 89 high school students from a selected Slovene high school and interaction, and whether the student outperformed their partner). The outcome of interest was a three-state dependent variable indicating whether the student responded well to the implementation of tandem learning into the education environment. The present study tested which predictor variables were most important using mutual information and recursive feature elimination for all variables. The most important factors according to mutual information for predicting student response were outperforming the partner, class, and qualitative qualitative interaction, outperforming partner and gender.;1694-609X;1308-1470

To address the weakness of the AHP in determining weight in the comprehensive evaluation system, the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-AHP model proposed in this paper is based on the PSO in the meta-heuristic algorithm. The model was used to solve the indicator weights in the evaluation system of AI education in primary and secondary schools in Fujian Province and was compared with the genetic algorithm and war strategy optimization algorithm. From the comparison results, the PSO-AHP optimization is more effective among the three algorithms, and the indicator consistency can be improved by about 30%. They are both effective in solving the problem that once the judgment matrix is given in the AHP, the weights and indicator consistency cannot be improved. Finally, the results were tested by Friedman statistics to prove the viability of the proposed algorithm.;1557-3958;1557-3966

The effect of POGIL in learning result was somehow vary in many studied. One problem found in our observation, students were not able to apply their new knowledge at application step of POGIL model. This paper reports our effort to improve student's cognitive learning outcome in learning buffer solution by modifying POGIL at application step. Buffer solution is one part of chemistry at high school of which students had difficulties in understanding it. In learning buffer, it requires ability in conceptual understanding and algorithmic problem solving. Polya's problem solving method has known as one powerful problem solving model in mathematics. We had modified POGIL by incorporating Polya's problem solving steps at application step of POGIL and implemented the model in learning buffer solution. Although only 50% student passed the school passing grade in experimental class, the modified model seem superior compared to original POGIL. In control class only 16% students passed the school passing grade. The mean rank value in the Maim-Whitney test in the experimental class (46.61) was higher than the control class (26.39). Therefore, modified POGIL was proven to be better model in learning buffer solution. This study was done in a short period of learning buffer solution.

To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively.

Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules.

English knowledge points are complex, and domestic scholars have studied vocabulary knowledge and grammatical awareness from various perspectives, but there is still a lack of research on the correlation between vocabulary knowledge, grammatical awareness, and cloze test scores of senior high school students. Therefore, this paper carries out empirical research from the depth of English vocabulary, English grammar, reading comprehension, cloze test, and composition, aiming at exploring the relationship between teaching quality and English knowledge points. Classroom teaching quality evaluation is the basic content of education quality evaluation, which not only needs to evaluate the effect of class hours but also needs a student's long-term learning effect. In order to improve the quality of classroom English teaching, enrich the content of classroom English, and ultimately make the quality of students' learning to a higher level, the combination model of the teaching quality evaluation index is established by combining the decision tree with the knowledge point rule association method and the evaluation results are verified by association rule analysis. This paper selects the effective indicators that affect the evaluation of English teaching quality, determines the weight of the indicators by using the analytic hierarchy process, effectively constructs the combination model of the decision tree and rule association method, and establishes the evaluation model of students' English learning ability in the classroom. Taking students as the main object and combining them with the requirements of digital teaching, the evaluation index system is formed, the index weight is determined by using the analytic hierarchy process, and the classroom teaching quality evaluation model based on the decision tree and English knowledge point correlation analysis is constructed to truly reflect the teaching level of teachers, and the correlation analysis is carried out between English teachers' own quality and students' learning effects and knowledge points. By testing the model performance of English vocabulary depth, reading comprehension, grammar, writing, and other knowledge points, we can well evaluate and analyze students' mastery of English learning and the correlation of English knowledge points.;1687-5265;1687-5273

Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes.";1360-2357;1573-7608

In this study, the power of various machine learning techniques to learn the complicated task of predicting students' performance in math courses using demographic data of 395 students was investigated. Predicting students' performance through demographic information makes it possible to predict their performance before the start of the course. Filtered and wrapper feature selection methods were used to find 10 important features in predicting students' final math grades. Then, all the features of the data set as well as the 10 selected features of each of the feature selection methods were used as input for the regression analysis with the Adaboost model. Finally, the prediction performance of each of these feature sets in predicting students' math grades was evaluated using criteria such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and mean squared error. The best result was obtained from feature selection by the LASSO method. After the LASSO method for feature selection, the Extra Tree and Gradient Boosting Machine methods respectively had the best prediction of the final math grade. The present study showed that the LASSO feature selection technique integrated with regression analysis with the Adaboost model is a suitable data mining framework for predicting students' mathematical performance.;2158-107X;2156-5570

We propose batch and decomposition methods to generate good-quality initial solutions and a dynamic Thompson sampling based hyper-heuristic framework, as a local search mechanism, which explores the large solution space of this problem in an integrative way. The characteristics of our test instances comply with average secondary schools in the Netherlands and are based on expert opinions and surveys. The experiments, which benchmark the proposed heuristics against Gurobi MIP solver on small instances, illustrate the computational challenge of this problem numerically. According to our experiments, the batch method seems quicker and also can provide better quality solutions for the instances in which resource levels are not scarce, while the decomposition method seems more suitable in resource scarcity situations. The dynamic Thompson sampling based online learning heuristic selection mechanism is shown to provide significant value to the performance of our hyper-heuristic local search.

The selection of the incorrect qualification increases the risk of dropping out, changing qualifications, or not finishing the qualification enrolled in the minimum time. This study harnesses a real-world dataset comprising student records across four engineering disciplines from the 2016 and 2017 academic years at a public South African university. The study examines the relative importance of features in models for predicting student performance and determining whether students are better suited for extended or mainstream programmes. The study employs a three-step methodology, encompassing data pre-processing, feature importance selection, and model training with evaluation, to predict student performance by addressing issues such as dataset imbalance, biases, and ethical considerations. By relying exclusively on high school performance data, predictions are based solely on students' abilities, fostering fairness and minimising biases in predictive tasks. The results show that removing demographic features like ethnicity or nationality reduces bias. The study's findings also highlight the significance of the following features: mathematics, physical sciences, and admission point scores when predicting student performance.

Despite its recognized importance, research on predictors of self-efficacy using machine learning models remains limited, particularly within Muslim societies. This study addresses this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze key factors influencing students' self-efficacy.Methods An empirical dataset collected was used to examine self-efficacy among secondary school students in Muslim societies. Four machine learning algorithms-Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network-were employed to predict self-efficacy using two demographic variables and 10 socio-emotional, cognitive, and regulatory factors. The predictors included culturally relevant variables such as religious/spiritual beliefs and collectivist-individualist orientation. Model performance was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE) and r-squared (R2) metrics to ensure reliability and validity.Results The results showed that Random Forest outperformed the other models in accuracy, as measured by R2 and RMSE metrics. Among the predictors, self-regulation, problem-solving, and a sense of belonging emerged as the most significant factors, contributing to more than half of the model's predictive power. Other variables such as gratitude, forgiveness, empathy, and meaning-making displayed moderate predictive value, while gender, emotion regulation, and collectivist-individualist orientation had minimal impact. Notably, religious/spiritual beliefs and regional factors showed negligible influence on self-efficacy predictions.Discussion This study enhances the understanding of factors influencing self-efficacy among students in Muslim societies and offers a data-driven foundation for developing targeted educational interventions. The findings highlight the utility of machine learning in education research, demonstrating its ability to uncover insights for equitable and effective decision-making. By emphasizing the importance of regulatory and socio-emotional factors, this research provides actionable insights to elevate student performance and well-being in diverse cultural contexts.;;2624-909X

Despite efforts made in this regard, learning outcomes have not improved sufficiently. Therefore, further investigation is needed on this issue, adopting new perspectives (conceptual and analytical) to facilitate the understanding and design of effective actions. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of executive functions (considering both cognitive and affective processes) and their interactions on learning outcomes in Language and Literature and Mathematics in Spanish students, through the use of artificial intelligence, based on the machine learning approach, and more specifically, the decision tree technique. A total of 173 students in compulsory secondary education (12-17 years old) from the same educational institution participated. The school's educational counsellor provided information on student executive function levels by completing the BRIEF2 questionnaire for each participant. She also reported on the learning outcomes achieved by students in the subjects of interest for this research (Language and Literature and Mathematics). R software was used to model the regression trees. The results revealed groups of students characterised by different profiles, i.e., by different combinations of difficulties in various executive functions and varying levels of learning outcomes in each academic area. However, regardless of the academic area considered (Language and Literature or Mathematics), working memory was identified as the most relevant executive function in all of the students' learning outcomes. Understanding the combination of executive functions that predict learning outcomes in each group of students is important since it enables teachers and other educational professionals, policymakers and researchers to provide individualised educational resources according to the diverse student profiles and needs. It constitutes an effective mechanism to improve students' learning results and, ultimately, to enhance an equitable and more effective educational system.;;2662-9992

Even after 6-9 weeks, there was no significant drop in the acquired knowledge scores (analog: p = 0.619; digital: p = 0.092) compared to the immediate post-test observed. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the knowledge levels reached after both interventions. The knowledge scores showed typical learning profiles of earlier studies including its consistency even after several weeks. Since no significant differences appeared for the knowledge gain of both groups, the kind of teaching seemingly does not originate any influence independent of participation in the digital or analog module. The same seems to be valid for notebook entry options.";;1999-4907

A previous clinical trial suggests that Goal2Quit, a behavioral activation-based smoking cessation mobile app, effectively increases smoking abstinence and reduces depressive symptoms. Objective: Secondary analyses were conducted on these trial data to identify predictors of success in depression-specific digitalized cessation interventions. Methods: Adult who smoked cigarettes (age = 38.4 +/- 10.3, 53% women) were randomized to either use Goal2Quit for 12 weeks (N = 103), paired with a 2-week sample of nicotine replacement therapy (patch and lozenge) or to a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) control (N = 47). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was utilized to identify a subset of baseline variables predicting either smoking or depression intervention outcomes. The retained predictors were then fitted via linear regression models to determine relations to each intervention outcome. Results: Relative to TAU, only individuals who spent significant time using Goal2Quit (56 +/- 46 min) were more likely to reduce cigarette use by at least 50% after 12 weeks, whereas those who spent minimal time using Goal2Quit (10 +/- 2 min) did not exhibit significant changes. An interaction between educational attainment and treatment group revealed that, as compared to TAU, only app users with an educational degree beyond high school exhibited significant reductions in depression. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of tailoring depression-specific digital cessation interventions to individuals' unique engagement needs and educational level. This study provides a potential methodological template for future research aimed at personalizing technology-based treatments for cigarette users with depressive symptoms.;1082-6084;1532-2491

Learning analytics is a new field with a key role in educational institutions in the coming years. It may help make strategic decisions to reduce student disengagement. The use of technology in educational environments has grown significantly and, with it, awareness of the importance of student engagement. We exploit tracking and wearable technologies to increase user engagement in learning processes, exploring also the area of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). We use wearables and Internet of Things for education, an interactive and collaborative system designed to improve motivation and learning. This article presents the results obtained in different experiments conducted in a secondary school in a long-term participatory learning context. The captured data were analyzed and used to identify different students' behavior patterns, showing their progress and motivation. Subsequently, from the captured data and aiming at a decision-making phase, we used machine learning techniques and MMLA methodologies to construct models able to explain when student engagement is present, so this knowledge can later be exploited. In particular, we chose decision trees and rule systems based on a set of variables with proven relevance to the problem. The evaluation of this novel engagement classification system confirms the high performance of these variables. The rules obtained, which can be easily interpreted by a nonexpert, help the teacher to observe, analyze, and make decisions with the purpose of fostering engagement.;1939-1382;

Recent developments in machine learning have allowed for nearly perfect hand-tracking recognition, introducing a touchless modality for interaction within Augmented Reality (AR) environments. However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or Learning by Doing , hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world. Meanwhile, machine learning has gained attention for its ability to enhance personalized learning and play a vital new role as a virtual instructor. This paper proposes a novel approach called the AGILEST approach, which uses machine learning Agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in STEM education through touchless interaction. The first case study for this approach will be an AR learning application for chemistry. This application uses real-time touchless hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and uses a machine learning agent to act as both trainer and assessor of the user. The evaluation of this research has been conducted remotely through a usability study with expert reviewers, which includes 15 young researchers with peer-reviewed work in Human-Computer Interaction & AR and 2 subject experts STEM teachers at the secondary school level. The usability evaluation through NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), Perceived Ease of Use (PUEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) with expert reviewers provide positive feedback about this approach for productive learning gain, engagement and interactiveness in learning STEM subjects.;;2772-5030

The study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods strategy, starting with a systematic survey and followed by detailed interviews. The Mathematics Teachers' Awareness and Perceptions of AI-based ChatGPT Questionnaire (MTAPACQ) used in this study was adapted from an existing online survey and administered to 80 mathematics teachers, who were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure varied representation across different local government areas. The survey explored teachers' awareness, utilisation, and perceptions of ChatGPT. Following the quantitative phase, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of five teachers who were familiar with ChatGPT to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings indicate limited awareness of ChatGPT, with only 17% demonstrating familiarity with the technology. The infrequent utilisation of ChatGPT in mathematics teaching is mainly associated with this limited awareness. Teachers who integrate ChatGPT report positive outcomes, including improved teaching effectiveness, heightened student engagement, and enhanced comprehension of complex concepts. Nevertheless, the overall perceptions of the tool's impact on mathematics teaching and learning are moderate. The identified challenges in relation to integration include technical adaptability, curriculum alignment, and the need for customisation to accommodate diverse learning styles. This study emphasises the significance of continuous professional development and ongoing support for teachers to integrate AI-based ChatGPT into mathematics instruction proficiently. The insights derived from the findings hold value for educators, policymakers, and technology developers aspiring to elevate the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics education.;;2227-7102

In addition to potential challenges regarding data quality and the choice of variables, a key factor in the success of participatory monitoring projects is the active participation of volunteers, the citizen scientists. To learn more about the motivation of citizen scientists to participate and their socio-economic background, a telephone survey was implemented with participants of a citizen science water level monitoring program in the Sondu-Miriu basin, western Kenya. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and random forest models to elucidate the characteristics of the participant population, underlying motivations, and the challenges and opportunities to develop recommendations for sustainable community-based water monitoring programs. As citizen scientists who engaged long-term were 30-49 years old, had primary or secondary school education and passed by the monitoring station frequently, targeting sensitization activities at people with such background could increase participation in community-based water monitoring. Sensitization meetings were key in engaging long-term volunteers, but participants indicated that continued feedback through education and communication of the project findings is required to keep volunteers motivated. The use of cellphone credit to submit data was identified as challenge for participation, highlighting the need for data submission methods that do not incur costs for the participants. Greater volunteer support could also be achieved by active involvement of the members of Water Resource Users Associations, since membership increased the likelihood of continuous engagement in water monitoring under the participants. Furthermore, many participants indicated that their motivation was to help water management and conservation, as most people rely directly on rivers for their water supply. Providing a platform to contribute to better water resources management could therefore result in direct benefits (e.g., improved water supply) for the participants, and thus an incentive to participate actively.;;2296-6463
"Araya, Roberto; Isoda, Masami; van der Molen Moris, Johan";Developing Computational Thinking Teaching Strategies to Model Pandemics and Containment Measures;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH;10.3390/ijerph182312520;Article;2021;COVID-19 has been extremely difficult to control. The lack of understanding of key aspects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incorporate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families.;;1660-4601
"Houngue, Pelagie; Hountondji, Michel; Dagba, Theophile";An Effective Decision-Making Support for Student Academic Path Selection using Machine Learning;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;;Article;2022;In Benin, after the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), learners can either enroll in a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), or further their studies in the general education. Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6(th) to 9(th) grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners' ability and the stream. As a result, for learners' ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners' stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods. Furthermore, it provides a tool to ease students academic path selection, which may be used by educational institutes to ensure student performance.

Wang, Zhihui;Higher Education Management and Student Achievement Assessment Method Based on Clustering Algorithm;COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE;10.1155/2022/4703975;Article;2022;Monitoring and guiding instructional management require student performance evaluation. Traditional evaluation and analysis methods based on absolute scores, on the other hand, have certain flaws and are unable to fully reflect the information contained in student performance, thus limiting the impact of student performance evaluation on teaching and learning management. Data mining is regarded as the backbone technology for future information processing, and it introduces a new concept to the way humans use data. Schools must analyse and evaluate the performance of students in the same grade level and secondary school in a timely and staged manner. Clustering is a type of data mining that uses similarity rules to classify sample data into groups with a high degree of similarity. To address the difficulties caused by the wide variation in course difficulty in student performance evaluation, a method based on the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The K-means algorithm and the improved K-means algorithm with student information are investigated. The test results showed that the K-means clustering algorithm, the improved algorithm in this paper, and the fast global mean clustering algorithm all cluster the same randomly generated data set with noisy points, but the clustering time of the algorithm in this paper is only 0.04, which has obvious advantages. As a result, the clustering algorithm-based higher education management and student performance evaluation mechanism provides some insights for future research on student learning patterns. It is hoped that instructional administrators will gain a better understanding of students' learning characteristics so that they can better guide their teaching.;1687-5265;1687-5273

It explores how AI-driven adaptive learning systems, informed by neurophysiological insights, enhance personalized education for K-12 students and adult learners. This study emphasizes the role of Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and other neurophysiological tools in assessing cognitive states and guiding AI-powered interventions to refine instructional strategies dynamically. Methods: This study reviews n = 103 papers related to the integration of principles of CLT with AI and ML in educational settings. It evaluates the progress made in neuroadaptive learning technologies, especially the real-time management of cognitive load, personalized feedback systems, and the multimodal applications of AI. Besides that, this research examines key hurdles such as data privacy, ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and scalability issues while pinpointing best practices for robust and effective implementation. Results: The results show that AI and ML significantly improve Learning Efficacy due to managing cognitive load automatically, providing personalized instruction, and adapting learning pathways dynamically based on real-time neurophysiological data. Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) improve classification accuracy, making AI-powered adaptive learning systems more efficient and scalable. Multimodal approaches enhance system robustness by mitigating signal variability and noise-related limitations by combining EEG with fMRI, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Despite these advances, practical implementation challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data security risks, and accessibility disparities across learner demographics. Conclusions: AI and ML are epitomes of redefinition potentials that solid ethical frameworks, inclusive design, and scalable methodologies must inform. Future studies will be necessary for refining pre-processing techniques, expanding the variety of datasets, and advancing multimodal neuroadaptive learning for developing high-accuracy, affordable, and ethically responsible AI-driven educational systems. The future of AI-enhanced education should be inclusive, equitable, and effective across various learning populations that would surmount technological limitations and ethical dilemmas.;;2076-3425
Mgonja, Thomas;Using interpretable machine learning approaches to predict and provide explanations for student completion of remedial mathematics;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;10.1007/s10639-024-12647-6;Article;2024;The successful completion of remedial mathematics is widely recognized as a crucial factor for college success. However, there is considerable concern and ongoing debate surrounding the low completion rates observed in remedial mathematics courses across various parts of the world. This study applies explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools to interpret predictions on whether students will complete mathematics remediation. Various machine learning models are compared, with random forest emerging as superior in predicting non-completion. Global interpretations using correlation analysis, logistic regression, feature importance, permutation importance, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) summary plots identify significant predictors such as college grade point average (G.P.A), high school G.P.A, starting point in the remedial sequence, number of failed remedial courses, delay in remediation, Rate My Professor scores, and age. Additionally, local interpretations using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) analyses were utilized to garner tailored advise for at-risk students. It was observed that instructor attributes cannot be overlooked, especially, when exploring local interpretations. Future research should consider other features such as a students' socio-economic status (SES), employment status, and placement exam scores. Future studies could also involve data from multiple institutions and examine user experience in implementing these models.;1360-2357;1573-7608

Apart from setting English as a compulsory course like Chinese and Mathematics in schools, various English training institutions outside the school are also emerging one after another. Due to the English teaching mode in class, dumb English appears. In recent years, with the popularity of virtual electronic devices, more and more researchers try to use virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive English learning environment. Oral English teaching is an important part of the whole English teaching. In the traditional English classroom teaching practice, teachers' pronunciation is not standard, and students are difficult to learn the correct pronunciation standard, which makes oral English very passive. The most important problem in oral English teaching is to improve students' interest in oral English, make students willing to speak and realize English communication. Oral English teaching is an important link in both primary and secondary schools and universities. Teachers are afraid of nonstandard pronunciation in limited classrooms, and they are afraid to speak and unwilling to speak, which leads to passive oral English teaching. Therefore, this paper will set up an intelligent computing model to evaluate and analyze spoken English in a standard and accurate way. Artificial intelligence speech synthesis and imitation of voice change are typical applications of decoupling representation learning in speech, the oral evaluation is based on the proposition that speech is a dynamic and complex process. With the help of the rapidly developed computer speech synthesis and imitation technology, an oral evaluation path based on speech synthesis and imitation is proposed, that is, oral evaluation is carried out by using the network parameters and output of deep learning of computer speech imitation.;1058-9244;1875-919X

The research on efficient large-scale distributed parallelized data mining and machine learning methods and algorithms is carried out. As an innovative teaching model, the experiential teaching model focuses on the cultivation of individual students' independent learning ability and subjective initiative, which not only can effectively activate the classroom atmosphere and improve the teaching effect but also meet the requirements of classroom teaching for the development of the times. The empirical evidence of the experiential teaching model proposed in this paper is carried out, and the implementation process of the experiential teaching model of high school physics is further improved. In terms of the overall implementation effect, the experiential teaching model proposed in the paper can deepen students' understanding of concepts and physical laws, thus enabling them to solve physics problems better, and has a positive and active effect on enhancing students' learning interests and attitudes. In the case of system security, the average comprehensive index of each unit is 61.11, 22 are higher than the average index, accounting for 61.11%, 14 are lower than the average index, accounting for 38.89%, and 23 management departments' management systems passed the safety monitoring, accounting for 63.89%.

Firstly, this work analyzes the research status of the mental health model (MHM) and the main contents of PSE student-oriented mental health quality cultivation under deep learning (DL). Secondly, an MHM is implemented based on big data technology (BDT) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). Simultaneously, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced to optimize the proposed MHM. Finally, the performance of the MHM before and after optimization is evaluated, and the PSE student-oriented mental health quality training strategy based on the proposed MHM is offered. The results show that the accuracy curve is higher than the recall curve in all classification algorithms. The maximum recall rate is 0.58, and the minimum accuracy rate is 0.62. The decision tree (DT) algorithm has the best comprehensive performance among the five different classification algorithms, with accuracy of 0.68, recall rate of 0.58, and F1-measure of 0.69. Thus, the DT algorithm is selected as the classifier. The proposed MHM can identify 56% of students with MDs before optimization. After optimization, the accuracy is improved by 0.03. The recall rate is improved by 0.19, the F1-measure is improved by 0.05, and 75% of students with MDs can be identified. Diverse behavior data can improve the recognition effect of students' MDs. Meanwhile, from the 60th iteration, the mode accuracy and loss tend to be stable. By comparison, batch size has little influence on the experimental results. The number of convolution kernels of the first convolution layer has little influence. The proposed MHM based on DL and CNN will indirectly improve the mental health quality of PSE students. The research provides a reference for cultivating the mental health quality of PSE students.;1687-5265;1687-5273

Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness.

Educational robots are specifically designed and used for teaching and learning purposes and attain the interest of learners in gaining knowledge about science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Educational robots are widely applied in different fields of primary and secondary education, but their usage in teaching higher education subjects is limited. Even when educational robots are used in tertiary education, the use is sporadic, targets specific courses or subjects, and employs robots with narrow applicability. In this work, we propose a holistic approach to the use of educational robots in tertiary education. We demonstrate how an open source educational robot can be used by colleges, and universities in teaching multiple courses of a computer science curriculum, fostering computational and creative thinking in practice. We rely on an open-source and open design educational robot, called FOSSBot, which contains various IoT technologies for measuring data, processing it, and interacting with the physical world. Grace to its open nature, FOSSBot can be used in preparing the content and supporting learning activities for different subjects such as electronics, computer networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, etc. To support our claim, we describe a computer science curriculum containing a wide range of computer science courses and explain how each course can be supported by providing indicative activities. The proposed one-year curriculum can be delivered at the postgraduate level, allowing computer science graduates to delve deep into Computer Science subjects. After examining related works that propose the use of robots in academic curricula we detect the gap that still exists for a curriculum that is linked to an educational robot and we present in detail each proposed course, the software libraries that can be employed for each course and the possible extensions to the open robot that will allow to further extend the curriculum with more topics or enhance it with activities. With our work, we show that by incorporating educational robots in higher education we can address this gap and provide a new ledger for boosting tertiary education.;2073-431X;

It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first programming language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN).Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables.Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in Logo language development. It encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.;;2475-1421

Unlike K-12 science and mathematics education, there is not currently a research foundation for K-12 AI education. In this article we provide a component-based definition of AI literacy, present the need for implementing AI literacy education across all grade bands, and argue for the creation of research programs across four areas of AI education: (1) K-12 AI Learning & Technology; (2) K-12 AI Education Integration into STEM, Language Arts, and Social Science Education; (3) K-12 AI Professional Development for Teachers and Administrators; and (4) K-12 AI Assessment.";1560-4292;1560-4306

Different education standards consider Collaboration as a required and necessary skill that can help students excel in these fields. Instruction-based methods is the most common approach, adopted by teachers to instill collaborative skills. However, it is difficult for a single teacher to observe multiple student groups and provide constructive feedback to each student. With growing student population and limited teaching staff, this problem seems unlikely to go away. Development of machine-learning-based automated systems for student group collaboration assessment and feedback can help address this problem. Building upon our previous work, in this paper, we propose simple CNN deep-learning models that take in spatio-temporal representations of individual student roles and behavior annotations as input for group collaboration assessment. The trained classification models are further used to develop an automated recommendation system to provide individual-level or group-level feedback. The recommendation system suggests different roles each student in the group could have assumed that would facilitate better overall group collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a feedback system. We also list the different challenges faced when working with the annotation data and describe the approaches we used to address those challenges.;;2624-9898
"Wang, Deliang; Chen, Gaowei";Are perfect transcripts necessary when we analyze classroom dialogue using AIoT?;INTERNET OF THINGS;10.1016/j.iot.2024.101105;Article;2024;Classroom dialogue plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning. Many researchers have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) to develop models and systems for automatic analysis and feedback. However, the question of whether we should employ these AIoT tools on automatic transcripts of classroom dialogue generated by automatic speech recognition software or on transcripts that have undergone human revision remains unresolved, which involves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Thus, this paper examines whether perfect transcripts are needed to analyze talk moves in classroom dialogue. We initially constructed two deep learning models to analyze teacher talk moves in K-12 mathematics lessons. Subsequently, we collected an additional set of six K-12 mathematics lesson videos and used a classroom dialogue analysis system equipped with speech recognition software to automatically transcribe them, resulting in ASR_pure transcripts. These transcripts were then manually revised and verified to create ASR_human transcripts. A comparison between the two types of transcripts revealed evident errors in the ASR_pure transcripts. Next, we employed the developed AI models to predict talk moves in both ASR_pure and ASR_human transcripts and assessed their consistency. The findings demonstrate a high level of consistency in talk move prediction between the two types of transcripts across the six lessons. Furthermore, the ASR_pure transcripts also exhibit high consistency in specific talk moves (e.g., pressing for accuracy) when compared to ASR_human transcripts. We propose a hypothesis that this consistency between inaccurate ASR_pure transcripts and perfect ASR_human transcripts can be attributed to the ASR software accurately recognizing key indicators that serve as talk moves, rather than accurately identifying every word. Notably, upon removing the key indicator words from teacher utterances, both the talk move level and lesson level consistency experience a substantial decline. Therefore, we suggest that perfect transcripts of classroom dialogue may not be necessary for AIoT to analyze teacher talk moves and provide teachers with prompt and accurate feedback, especially when the ASR software can accurately recognize keywords.;2543-1536;2542-6605

However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students' needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students' individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students' science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both - meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students' learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students' learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students' learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students' learning - the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.;;2504-284X

The current study examined whether learning styles based on the Felder-Silverman classification (perception, input, processing and organization of information) influence learning in GBL. Only the input and processing scales were found to be reliable. 109 students from prevocational secondary education played a math game (proportional reasoning) after which learning gain and motivation were measured. Gameplay yielded no learning, but a median-split breakdown (prior knowledge) indicated that students with little prior knowledge did learn from the game, while those with much prior knowledge deteriorated. Subsequent multiple regression analyses revealed no predictive effect for motivation. The processing preference was predictive for learning: Students with an active processing preference performed better than students with a reflective processing preference. The discussion discusses consequences and a number of directions for follow-up research.;2155-6849;2155-6857

However, research on unplugged activities' influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi- experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students' mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students' CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem- posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students' mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students' interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.;1871-1871;1878-0423

Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synthesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored.;0360-1315;1873-782X

This is mainly evident in the fact that average students, who do not have any learning difficulties, are required to solve the same tasks from the same textbook in the same order. Artificial intelligence and other smart learning tools present great opportunities for implementing a personalized learning system. Our previous surveys and literature reviews also show that educators see the greatest potential in personalized education for the assimilation of artificial intelligence into education. In this context, we have developed educational software called Learn with M.E. as Math Educator, which facilitates more personalized teaching of basic mathematical operations. This study presents the structure and operation of this application. We tested the usability of the software in several institutions. Our research target group consists of elementary school students, specifically those aged 11-15. This article provides a detailed overview of the accuracy and educational outcomes of the completed application. We evaluated the application and its effectiveness using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our research design combined elements of educational technology development and effectiveness assessment. To evaluate student performance, we employed a control group methodology. Data were analyzed by comparing test results between students using the software and those receiving traditional instruction. We examined user satisfaction through survey questionnaires. Teachers' opinions were gathered through structured interviews, and their responses were categorized using a SWOT analysis. The findings indicated that the use of the software significantly improved students' mathematics performance compared to the control group. Students provided positive feedback on the software's user interface, describing it as user-friendly and motivating. Teachers regarded the software as an effective educational tool, facilitating differentiated instruction and enhancing student engagement. The results suggest that digital educational tools, such as the developed software, can provide substantial added value in education.;;2227-7102

However, including computational thinking into science instruction may be challenging. Therefore, for biological evolution (an essential theory within biology that spans across temporal and organizational scales), we recommend integrating computational thinking into evolution teaching to overcome misconceptions, reinforce the nature of science (NOS), and allow student embodiment (as students become emerged in their models, i.e., personification). We present a learning progression, which outlines biological evolution learning coupled with computational thinking. The defined components of computational thinking (input, integration, output, and feedback) are integrated with biology student roles. The complex nature of both teaching computational thinking and biological evolution lends toward a learning progression that identifies instructional context, computational product, and computational process and spans from simple to complex. Two major themes of biological evolution, unity and diversity have each been paired with both computational thinking and specific corresponding NGSS standards at levels of increasing complexity. There are virtually no previous studies which relate computation and evolution across scales, which paves the way for questions of importance, support, benefits, and overall student achievement in relation to the advancement of science in education.;0926-7220;1573-1901

Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined. Results indicated that boys had significantly higher AI Knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher AI Affectivity than boys.

Predictive models have been developed to determine the likelihood of students dropping out of their studies precociously to overcome such a problem. Academic systems, which gather data from many students, are potential sources for datasets that feed dropout prediction algorithms, thus leading to general improvements in education quality. Despite successful past attempts to predict dropout, several works depict small datasets with features that are hard to reproduce. Furthermore, predicting whether a student will drop out is not enough to diagnose and prevent the problem as it is also necessary to provide potential justifications for the dropout. This paper proposes an approach for creating and enriching a dataset for dropout prediction, which has been applied for dropout prediction using data from 19 schools in Brazil. With this dataset and using classifiers and model explaining techniques, our experiments achieved Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) scores of up to 89.5%, Precision up to 95%, Recall up to 93%, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) rates up to 97% when predicting dropout at different year moments. This study also shows differences when predicting dropouts in different educational stages, such as preschool and secondary education, with the former being more complex than the latter. In addition to the high recognition rates, our proposal identifies potential reasons for student dropout, which are relevant for educational institutions to take preemptive actions.;0957-4174;1873-6793

Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China's Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the black box nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students' learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice.;;2227-7390

Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States.MethodsThis study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA.Results and ConclusionsThe findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups.ImplicationsThe findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings.;0266-4909;1365-2729

This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed.;1380-7501;1573-7721
"Chandrasekaran, Dhivya; Mago, Vijay";Automating Transfer Credit Assessment-A Natural Language Processing-Based Approach;CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA;10.32604/cmc.2022.027236;Article;2022;Student mobility or academic mobility involves students moving between institutions during their post-secondary education, and one of the challenging tasks in this process is to assess the transfer credits to be offered to the incoming student. In general, this process involves domain experts comparing the learning outcomes of the courses, to decide on offering transfer credits to the incoming students. This manual implementation is not only labor-intensive but also influenced by undue bias and administrative complexity. The proposed research article focuses on identifying a model that exploits the advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively automate this process. Given the unique structure, domain specificity, and complexity of learning outcomes (LOs), a need for designing a tailor-made model arises. The proposed model uses a clustering-inspired methodology based on knowledge-based semantic similarity measures to assess the taxonomic similarity of LOs and a transformer-based semantic similarity model to assess the semantic similarity of the LOs. The similarity between LOs is further aggregated to form course to course similarity. Due to the lack of quality benchmark datasets, a new benchmark dataset containing seven course-to-course similarity measures is proposed. Understanding the inherent need for flexibility in the decision-making process the aggregation part of the model offers tunable parameters to accommodate different levels of leniency. While providing an efficient model to assess the similarity between courses with existing resources, this research work also steers future research attempts to apply NLP in the field of articulation in an ideal direction by highlighting the persisting research gaps.;1546-2218;1546-2226

However, little research examined the effectiveness of the explainable recommender, especially on academic performance. To survey its effectiveness, the authors evaluate the math academic performance among middle school students (n=115) by giving pre- and post-test questions based evaluation techniques. During the pre- and post-test periods, students were encouraged to use the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model based explainable recommendation system. To evaluate how well the students were able to do what they could not do, the authors defined growth rate and found recommended quiz clicked counts had a positive effect on the total number of solved quizzes (R=0.343, P=0.005) and growth rate (R=0.297, P=0.017) despite no correlation between the total number of solved quizzes and growth rate. The results suggest that the use of an explainable recommendation system that learns efficiently will enable students to do what they could not do before.;1539-3100;1539-3119

However, these approaches are susceptible to biases such as social desirability. Additionally, declarative approach cannot measure these parameters in real-time.PurposeThis study aims to apply Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) technology in an inquiry-based activity to address the limitations of traditional observational and declarative approaches. We measured students' emotions, engagement, and attention through the parametric measurement of facial expressions frame by frame.Method and procedureWe recruited a convenience sample of 12 secondary education pre-service teachers. Students participated in a 20-minute inquiry-based activity where they were tasked with identifying the contents of a sealed black box. We recorded their facial expressions and actions with a video camera, and the collected data was subsequently analysed by both a FER automatic software and a human observer.ResultsDuring the activity, Attention had a mean presence of 81.24% & PLUSMN;5.93, Engagement had a presence of 31.86% & PLUSMN;9.10, Joy of 7.62% & PLUSMN;7.11, and Surprise of 6.57% & PLUSMN;4.61. The presence of the other discrete emotions was low. Our analysis further revealed an evolution of these parameters and students' actions, progressing through three distinct phases: accommodation to the problem (Phase 1), exploration of problem-solving strategies (Phase 2), and implementation of problem-solving strategies (Phase 3). Based on these observations, we grouped students into three patterns based on the phases they underwent throughout the activity.ConclusionThis study shows the application of FER technology for identifying and analysing the progression of students' emotions, engagement, and attention during an inquiry-based activity. FER technology allows real-time and systematic measurement of emotions, engagement, and attention. However, this technology has inherent limitations, and further research is needed to optimise its application in the educational setting.";0263-5143;1470-1138

However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning.;;2076-3417
